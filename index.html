		<p>A new Chapter, for me usually means I moved somewhere or I did some other glorious thingy. In this case, we moved to Amarillo. We are still in the “woes of unpacking” stage where you sometimes mindlessly dump a box all over the place in hopes that the bits and pieces on the inside end up where you want them to go.</p>

<p>We now reside in a very held-together-with-glue-and-tooth-picks duplex next to a nice couple. He’s Hispanic and she’s white and they are adorable together. He thinks I’m the smartest thing on the planet and I tried explaining that I’m more diligent than smart. He still doesn’t believe it. I know a lot of shit, doesn’t means I’m genius material. More on that maybe in the future.</p>

<p>I’m currently sipping on a Bloody Mary, which is totally outside my element. I.E, it’s not beer. It’s good though. The V8 is spiked with sea salt and clam juice. Nice and rustic.I’d recommend this concoction to any foodie.</p>

<p>Work is still work. Today was a “Field Day” which means all the scientists were busy so I was left to my own devises. I worked on the prototype of my little 3D printed Pi box and spent the second part of the day rewriting my watch app I spun up a few months back in a hasty mess of code. I redid everything and went with the “%H:$M:%S” jazz that was suggested by a colleague. It’s a lot less code and still does the same thing so that is cool. Bonus points for lazy. I wish they spent more time on that concept in school. I did the original version in this barbaric math logic bullshit. It was just a messy piece of shit.</p>

<p>I think that’s all I got for now. No real political rants since it’s all beating dead horses by now. I’m not sure if I still stand by my Johnson vote at this point. I’d rather not have Trump since he will only leave the nation worse off then it is now. Clinton is still meh, but an actual politician, so she knows how the play the game. Idk, in any scenario I feel like I’m throwing my vote away. It’s sad. This isn’t democracy.</p>

<p>In any case, here’s to a new chapter. New 3 bedroom, 1.5bathroom duplex. Ready for baby makin’. I guess that will be the next chapter.</p>

		<p>I had started writing a blog last night but seemed to have ingested too much beer and realized I was starting some quasi-intelligent ramble but ended up on another Donald Trump rant. I deleted it as I had mentioned that I wanted to devote my blog time more to off-the-cuff stuff and I feel I’ve been ranting too much about him.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out before I move on: Trump caters to the lowest common denominator. That means that if you like him, you are the LCD. Urban Dictionary defines the LCD as the dumbass in a group of dumbasses. Both Stephen Hawking and Sam Harris has stated this. And both those people are known for their ability to think. In short, this is saying that if you follow Trump, you are dumb. Maybe not actually unintelligent, but dumb for following him. I know some educated people that are voting for him and they are outliers. Ok moving on.</p>

<p>I got formerly introduced to Sam Harris recently. I am sure I’ve heard the name in passing conversation since I discussed “The New Atheists” with a close friend a few times. I listened to the podcast of Dan Carlin’s with Harris on it and decided to switch gears to his own podcast “Waking Up.”</p>

<p>I realized in short order that we are both on the same page about a lot of stuff. I donno if he is just parroting what I’ve heard before or thought of independently but somehow we are on the same page.</p>

<p>I was enjoying the podcast until he released a previously unreleased debate between himself and Omar Aziz, a former radical Islamist. I stopped listening to it because it was just the two of them yelling at each other. The Ken Ham/Bill Nye debate had more tact than whatever this was.</p>

<p>So I’ve since moved on. I’m burning through some Freakonimics episodes until I get ready to either jump back into Carlin or Harris.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed Harris’ debate with Daniel Dennett about free will. I was lost in the sauce for some of it, as anyone might have guessed. Of all the philological exercises I’ve learned of, free will will always be beyond my understanding. I got an A on that paper back in school and still have no idea about it. The podcast is a fun listen to nonetheless. I’d suggest listening to it if you can sit down for the entire session since it’s hard to get back into the material. At least it was for me.</p>

<p>So where do I go from here, this “life after Trump”? I mean I know it ain’t over but at least the rest of the ride will be for the lulz. I like this current overload of new and revisited information that I’ve been doing so I’m gonna continue in that direction. I’ll follow up with this when I have had a moment to develop ideas about it.</p>

<p>In other news, I did some programming soul searching and have chosen to focus on Python until something changes. Keeping in mind that I’m not a good programmer, I will say this. The language is fairly easy to get into and since it’s syntactically minimalistic, it’s very conducive to learning new concepts about writing code. It’s a language that is 30 years old and doesn’t have a switch statement. That is programming survival of the fittest right there.</p>

<p>My reasoning behind choosing it are as follows; I’ve been using it at work lately since most of the Raspberry Pi project is done in Python. I’ve also been doing a few smaller projects on the side that is in Python. The one thing I’ve done that wasn’t was a watch app that I did in JavaScript since the watch can only run apps written in Objective C and JavaScript. I would have done it in ObjC since it’s less resource hungry but I know a bit of JS and almost no ObjC. I might rewrite it down the road but ClayJS was released recently and I want to check it out as well. Back to Python, another reason is that it’s the language that I started my journey with so I feel that it is suitable to end a chapter in my life by focusing on Python.</p>

<p>So while everyone is shooting each other and we have to decide on Clinton or Trump for president of the free world, I’m gonna just become a recluse and hide in my apartment and work on Python skills.</p>

<p>I think this is a good stopping point since the other stuff I wanted to write about is a handful of non sequiturs.</p>

		<p><strong>I LIED</strong></p>

<p>Ok so let&rsquo;s explore this RNG theory of mine before I decide on a proper name. And then maybe I can start into something else I have been wanting to write about.</p>

<p>So the podcast with Harris and Dennett uses a scenario involving Tiger Woods where he has a 999 out of 1000 chance of getting a golf ball in on a 2 foot put. And for some reason, he misses. They go into why he missed and whether it was up to some predetermined event or if he just partied to hard the night before. They even add a bird chirping at the right moment that took him out of the zone. Dennett eludes to the bird being a random event but I begot differ since a golf course is surrounded by trees and birds live in trees so chances are, there are birds. But I do get his point.</p>

<p>What I propose is that the two elements work together in a tug of war and can be manipulated. Well, free will can be manipulated which can change determinism. Ugh&hellip; Let&rsquo;s try this:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are on vacation in Vegas with your spouse. The vacation and location has been planned and everything is known ahead of time. So we will rule out any smartypants thinking there. Let&rsquo;s say however, that you like to gamble and your spouse doesn&rsquo;t like you to do so. Gambling in itself is innately random so that is why I chose this example. Let&rsquo;s say you promise you won&rsquo;t play poker at the casino that your hotel is connected to.</p>

<p>But you have a fight and after a few beers, you storm out of the hotel room and just start walking. You end up at the front doorway of the casino and figure, screw it, and you go in and pay for some chips, find a table and set down.</p>

<p>What is free will and what is per-determined? You have to follow the events to find out what is determined but what if a random even, or a series of them changes the destined outcome.</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t fight, you would have less of a chance or relapsing and gambling. Maybe we should include actually staying at the hotel with the casino connected.</p>

<p>Maybe the spouse deliberately challenged you to gamble.</p>

<p>so we have forces manipulating an otherwise uneventful situation.</p>

<p>You can choose not to gamble and you have, let&rsquo;s say a usually 1 in 4 chances of gambling due to your addiction. Let&rsquo;s say, frustration and fighting with your spouse raises that to 1 in 2 chances. a 50% chance is relatively common. If you&rsquo;ve played RNG-based video games you can agree.</p>

<p>So is the fight predetermined? What if you know you can avoid a fight? Did you start the fight of free will in order to gamble?</p>

<p>What if there are too many chances for either free will or determinism to be the right answer, I guess, is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at. What if there is an element of randomness involved?</p>

<p>This is, of course, assuming that we have actual RNG and not pseudo-RNG based on a computer-calculated seed.</p>

<p>I am officially more confused than when I started&hellip;</p>

<p>To be continued???</p>

<p>PS: I forgot what the other part I was gonan write about was suppsoed to be&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>Is it just determinism?</strong></p>

<p>I may have eluded to this a few posts ago but I had a bit of a tweet-fest a few weeks ago concerning the idea of why we should stop learning new things. I did my stint  at college and I should just stop reading new things or tinkering with a new programming language? Why? Just today at work I spent time playing with yet another library for Python that adds another new facet to a always impressive arsenal of tools that is Python. Python is simple as a language but it&rsquo;s extensibility is almost unmatched save for maybe JavaScript, and I blame the hipsters for that. Angular? Do we really need another stack guys?</p>

<p>Spent today playing with a GUI toolkit for Python called Tkinter. It&rsquo;s basically a whole library full of all the things you need to make the elements you see on a standards desktop OS window. Window decorations, buttons, text fields, sliders, radios, etc. It&rsquo;s like QT&rsquo;s distant, clunkier cousin. I say this only because QT has a IDE and Tkinter doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I spent today breaking windows and sifting through debug garbage while trying to get functional buttons. I&rsquo;m also trying(READ: failing) to get a nested terminal CLI to spit out terminal data as if you were running everything from CLI to begin with. It&rsquo;s not going well.</p>

<p>I also finished the podcast of Sam Harris' and Danial Dennett&rsquo;s barroom debate. I was happy that they finished it as the gentlemen I&rsquo;d like to think they are even though they disagreed with each other the entire time. It&rsquo;s weird reading two of the 4 horsemen, as they are referred to as, discuss the same thing, which they agree on, and yet, all the while disagreeing with each other. The discussion was intense and at times over my head.</p>

<p>After that I started a series from the same podcast where Harris is dissecting his most recent book since a lot of people apparently wanted to lynch him over it. I&rsquo;m halfway through the first part but from what I gather, he&rsquo;s trying to cover his ass but explaining that when he was discussing Muslims, he was intending to mean the radical militant ones and not ALL MUSLIMS. He explained that he thought his listeners understood that he was referencing Islamists and not Religion of Peace Muslims. I&rsquo;m curious about the book but probably won&rsquo;t read it. And Harris says that the audio version doesn&rsquo;t even paint him in the right light. I donno. I&rsquo;ll just take his word for it for now as I&rsquo;m just now diving into the New Atheist philosophy stuff.</p>

<p>I definitely can&rsquo;t defend anything they discuss yet. I don&rsquo;t know where I land on the atheism spectrum but I know I have shifted in the past decade. Is social atheism a thing? And if so, can it be coupled with existential nihilism?</p>

<p>I like overwhelming my brain as of late but I need to tread lighltly as nto to seem #verysmart</p>


<p>BRB, have to Google how to show a hash sign in markdown without turning it int oa header&hellip;</p>

<p>Ok. Continuing:</p>

<p>So I will be exploring philosophy as my new free study subject. I won&rsquo;t be engaging in discussion though. I&rsquo;m gonna try to avoid any foot-in-mouth like what I ended up with during Political-poluza 2016.</p>

<p>And if the rabbit hole ends up caving in on me, I can just move to a new subject to study. I still have Unity development I can learn, or finish working with the 2D roguelike python framework that I used to fork the tank roguelike a while back. Maybe I should just learn Python completely and be done with it. In any case. I have avenue to walk down and hopefully I will stop by a door wit ha light on and some new books to read.</p>

<p>I do have a theory on the subject of free will versus determinism. I think it&rsquo;s a bit of both. I think there maybe be a sort of biological RNG working behind the scenes. So if you subscribe to free will, it would mean that you choose to do a thing. If you subscribe to determinism, you are destined to do a thing. What if there is a weight chance of you being either destined to do a thing or a weighted chance that you can do the thing of your own will? more on this as I understand what the hell it is I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>

		<p>I like to listen to music when I write sometimes. When I wrote poetry a few generations of poems ago, I would listen to jazz as I felt that is what I needed to tap into my secret beatnik past. I&rsquo;m listening to a guilty-pleasure band now called Black Tongue. They are a novelty band of sorts. Down Tempo is a genre some people place on them. I&rsquo;d like to think they are the spiritual successors to an ill-fated genre of yore called Sludge Core or Sludge Metal. The like consists of unclean, usually nasally vocals coupled with very low tuned guitars with heavy chugging riffs and drums that are at once angry, dramatic and painfully slow. It&rsquo;s like listening to a normal heavier jsut-below-the-surface band but slowed down. Like you are high on some good weed or something. In any case I digress.</p>

<p>The system is corrupt! Raise your hand if you just heard the news. No? Nobody? Ok, I&rsquo;ll segway into the first possible topic I want to write about tonight.</p>

<p><strong>WHY I VOTED FOR THE BOOGY MAN</strong></p>

<p>This election season was a first for a lot of millennials. This election season was a good waking point for a lot of people. This was the first time I am aware that we had 2 anti-establishment candidates running. And both had a good chance of winning. Arguably, one still does. I have been a rabble-rouser for the majority of my life. I like disrupting the normal order of things whenever I can get the chance.  So when we had a rabble-rouser or two running, I started paying attention. This election, there was a candidate running that had the potential to really shake shit up in the Capital. Bernie Sander&rsquo;s now cult following was scary for most of the establishment. Much in the same way Trump is scary to educated people in and around the US.</p>

<p>I liked a lot of what Benie was spouting, not just because I was/am a student and there was a chance that I wouldn&rsquo;t end up paying a fuck ton of money for an education that should be pennies on the dollar should we have any hope for our country to continue as leaders in the sciences and maths, and not because I wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by his tax bracket switheroos. And of course, almost everyone reading this now or even in the4 future would have dodged that bullet. But I liked that he was a crazy, old Jew that came from nothing, had nothing and yet still manage to fight for the common good and equality of the country every chance he got. He has no money, he follows socialism in a pure form, and his stage presence probably helped a bit.</p>

<p>But, and this is a big BUT:</p>

<p>The reason I voted for the boogy man is because he wasn&rsquo;t Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.</p>

<p>And that is why I will be voting for Gary Johnson. I don&rsquo;t even know any of his stances on anything. But he isn&rsquo;t Hillary or Donald.</p>

<p>So we won&rsquo;t get our socialist president. It&rsquo;s ok. Sanders did a disservice for a lot of his anti-establishment followers when he publicly announced he is backing Hillary. It took the whole movement back a few years. The noise is gone now. The tide is receding and those who were angry enough to do anything are now playing Pokemon Go. Sanders is done and now we can only welcome either the Criminal or the Fraud with open arms.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Socialism/Anti-establishment movement should be over. Whether it actually is, I&rsquo;m unsure of just yet. Black Lives Matters is still relatively strong, even after the police shooting in Dallas. And they are very much anti-establishment. I just wish they could organize enough to know who the real bad guy is. We, the Socialist rabble-rousing folks are on their side. I am, for one a major supporter of unadulterated equal rights. I can&rsquo;t call myself any one label since I am personally wanting of equality for all. It&rsquo;s a tough fight in a nation dividing by every new bit of news anymore.</p>

<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t bode well if Trump becomes president. I know the loud ones are few and far between, and I know most of them are uneducated and don&rsquo;t really have any real means of shaking things up. I know this because I had an argument with one one time and he responded to my open acceptance of Socialism by saying &ldquo;If you love Socialism so much, why don&rsquo;t you move to North Korea?&rdquo; I paraphrased as to use proper grammar. But I was floored by this comment. Have you ever lost an argument that you were right on? It&rsquo;s a weird thing to say the least. Granted that is  small sample size, but there are more. Much more.</p>

<p>He has been talking for an entire year and hasn&rsquo;t said a single thing. Well, he has said stuff. He usually just spouts off racial slurs and basically acts like a complete bigot on stage and the anti-intellectualists eat it right up. He speaks to the lowest denominator and those in turn get the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; to live vicariously through him. How did I would this before&hellip; His supporters are ok with living a wee bit above poverty because they are told that if they work hard all their lives, they will rise a little bit on the societal ladder before they die and they use Trump as some sort of  Golden Idol to get them to crawl through the shit each day.</p>

<p>Hillary is bought and paid for shill. AT&amp;T put over $5 million in her pocket, big oil is in her bed and as was shown to us. the fucking FBI won&rsquo;t even do anything to hinder her chance in the white house. A meme came around a few weeks ago comparing Hillary to Edward Snowden. Snowden in an absolute hero for uncovering the illegal activities that the government was engaging in and he is now in exile. Hillary did something on the same level and is probably getting a seat in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Its weird.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gonan get weirder.</p>

<p>To be continued&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m grumpy today and I really don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe letting this blog go to the wayside hasn&rsquo;t helped me handle my own thoughts as of late. Maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy because that damn Pokemon Go app keeps shitting the bed for me. I just got back from walking all the way to campus and as if the app knew it, it just stopped working. I rebooted my phone and got a exclamation mark next to my phone battery and my screen wouldn&rsquo;t auto-adjust like it should and I&rsquo;ve been grumpy since before that and that just set me off and I went into Tamtrum Derrick Mode.</p>

<p>Maybe that was it. Can I blame it on the game? I love the idea of an ARG actually getting popular so I&rsquo;m very intrigued by it but all the same, it&rsquo;s a Pokemon game. I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m playing a silly Pokemon game. Maybe it&rsquo;s something different.</p>

<p>At this point I would usually segway into a list of things I&rsquo;d like to cover and write some sort of hyper-lengthy wall of text about why everything else is wrong and I&rsquo;m right but instead I think I&rsquo;ll try something new.</p>

<p>A confession of sorts.</p>

<p>I have been trolling the ever-loving shit out of a family-friend&rsquo;s Facebook buddies. I&rsquo;ve been engaging in some ruthless back and forth political banter and it&rsquo;s been a blast. I originally wanted to engage in actual worthwhile discussion but soon realized that they would always resort to childish name calling and decided to have fun with it ever since. The wife hates it. And I don&rsquo;t even know why I keep at it. I just like watching them squirm and fall into the Decartes-esque sort of pseudo-logical circular reasoning. I find it fascinating that I can predict their reactions based on what I say. It&rsquo;s the perfect example of cronyism. Or at least a sample of the cronyism that the country is controlled by.</p>

<p>You couple that with my recent binge-listening to Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Common Sense and I&rsquo;m starting to see how the whole political system works. The short explanation is “It doesn&rsquo;t.” And yeah, teenage angsty rebel Derrick knew that but for some reason at 30 or so I wanted to REALLY know that.</p>

<p>The fun factor is that in the process, I&rsquo;ve learned who I am politically. And I&rsquo;ve alienated almost my entire family because of it. That post will be for another day but for now let&rsquo;s focus on what is next.</p>

<p>It was this morning during the “24 Hour Facebook Fallout Rule” when said family-friend and cronies where back-and-forthing about the Dallas police shooting and how the police finally used a drone to subdue him. I&rsquo;ve so far succeeded in not giving my 2 cents. But it&rsquo;s easier this time. And this is why.</p>

<p>I am a futurist. I absolutely adore the possibilities of what the future will have, and will look like. I hunger for that sort of Utopian version where we have reached post-scarcity and monetary gratification is no longer needed. We are a long way off. Automation is going to get there and it will pave the way but we need to be careful about it. Automation won&rsquo;t exist as long as capitalism does. Well, it can&rsquo;t. If it doesn&rsquo;t then we see 1% get hyper-rich and 99% get hyper-poor. Imagine 280 Donald Trumps running the House and Senate. It would be like that only more narcissistic.</p>

<p>Robotics is going to disrupt the country and the world. We can joke all we want about McDonald&rsquo;s replacing the $15-per-hourers with kiosks but if we aren&rsquo;t going to prepare for the fallout that is unemployment that will surely follow we are digging an economic grave. Almost every job out there is as easily replaceable as the McDonald&rsquo;s cashier. If you don&rsquo;t realize that then you are an idiot.</p>

<p>Wat does this have to do with drones killing people? Aside from the fact that they have been doing that in the middle east for a few years now, this means that everything involving law enforcement changes. Those out there waving their gun rights in everyone&rsquo;s faces claiming that they should be able to shoot whomever they want if they trespass or look at them sideways just got a reality check. The 2nd amendment just got a little more fun. You have the right to bear arms but your arms will be substantially less affective against a remotely controlled machine.</p>

<p>If Asimov needed a chapter zero to his laws of robotics, this is it. Everything changes now. You can say it was unfair. You can say the police should have subdued him with bodily force and stuffed him in a jail cell until it was time for lethal injection. You can say all you want, but you have to understand that law enforcement will never be the same. This is a beginning and complaining about your guns and my rights and showing pictures of your guns leaning up against the wall not killing anybody is not what we need to be doing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this will spur new laws but considering how Congress is twiddling their thumbs about encryption, this is gonna take a while. I think the best way to speed things up is if some black hat hacker came along and hijacked one of those drones. Kill two(or three) birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Maybe down the road, I&rsquo;ll cover the whole alienating bit and encryption as if that hasn&rsquo;t been picked apart clean already.</p>

		<p>What happens now? I just finished wrapping up my last CIDM class and everything else is in order. I have one more class to take over the summer but I do get to walk on Saturday. So there is that. I&rsquo;m also finishing my entire college career with A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s because I tried.</p>

<p>So what now? I have a job lined up with the USDA but I also got a phone call from a staffing agency that needed a web developer position filled. After some sleuthing, it turns out that it was not a scam but there was just some oppsies with emails. That position offers twice what USDA is offering in the way of pay. Both jobs are temporary, but the web dev one is temp-to-hire. If they offer it to me, I kind of gotta take it but then I&rsquo;d be letting down the USDA folks who sent me an unofficial offer email the other day.</p>

<p>Then there was the web dev job for CSI that fell through but they still have a position opened that Babb mentioned today so I sent him an email that said toss my name in and let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll fill you in once I know what the hell is going on. I&rsquo;m gonna cut this short since I wanted to get started on re-learning PHP. I was gonna wait until next week but if not now, then never. Right?</p>

		<p>So I decided to move this blog to my local computer instead of hosting the dev version on cloud 9. A version will stll be there but it will probably not get updated unless I have a reason to do otherwise. Since I&rsquo;m just pushing and not actually doing any sort of QC, this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue and I can set up another repo on my laptop.</p>

<p>I might consider adding an new method in my rakefile for pulling all the things based on my &ldquo;rake push&rdquo; one.</p>

<p>Other then that, I had wanted to write a blog post about how I feel that the MMO is dying after trying to play Ryzom after it got it&rsquo;s debut on Steam after being around for 12 years. I played it, felt very &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it and will probably play Cities: Skylines for the rest of the night. It&rsquo;s holding my attention more anyway. At least, when I&rsquo;m not chasing down bugs and glitches from mods.</p>

<p>In any case, this is  gonna be shorter anyway since it&rsquo;s more intended to be a teser post to see if I have everything plugged in properly.</p>

<p>Peace,

		<p>Hello darkness, my old friend. Or rather oi to those who are still there and able to read something I write without being overly offended by crass observations of the politcal machine.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I wrote something for this little hacker-sheet blog but I have been having one hell for a semester as I work to tie up lose ends for a degree that will either be worth every penny or not.</p>

<p>I have fucked up in more ways then I care to admit in my online class and then that came through in a on-campus class, ironically taught by the same professor. I have forgotten to turn in 2 assignments, both of which were done a week before they were due, and I forgot to do a weekly busy-work assignment which counts as my drop assignment. Of course this happened before my professor made a decision to count all extra work that would otherwise be dropped towards our final grade in case we needed an extra push from a B to an A. Or in my case, from a D to a C.</p>

<p>So the past is behind us, right?</p>

<p>I chose 2 electives this semester to add a bit of zen to the otherwise chaotic months I knew were ahead. 1) Creative Writing: Poetry and 2) MCOM: Photography. Both have been an absolute blast. Halfway through my photography class, that professor started to give us a bit of creative wiggle room, which I being the pretentious/eccentric/asshole-ish/etc person that I have become, used to explore an avenue that I knew wasn&rsquo;t very known. Glitch Art is a very experimental and exploratory art style that involved literally breaking images and videos in such a way that they have digital artifacting and often, unexpected results. It&rsquo;s a style that looks awesome, creepy, surreal, and yet familiar. All at the same time. It&rsquo;s almost an homage to the last 30+ years of technological advancement on a personal level and that is what I find so intriguing about it. That NES game is fucked up and Mario is a blocking glitchy caricature of his former self? Fuck it, it&rsquo;s art now! I mean it has more depth then that but I like to imagine that happened in a cafe somewhere in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In any case I fell into a style that I can only describe as pseudo-bending, where you take an image and run it through a glitching app on your phone. I think the app uses similar algorithms that standard pixel sorting software, or the like uses but has a more instant result. I borrowed from the styles that a Flickr photographer named Kai Rennert uses and added some filters and tweeted the contrast/saturation/etc to aim for this sort of old-timy feel of more modern imagery. It&rsquo;s an interesting approach to say the least but there is a fine line between art and Instagram filter. I&rsquo;m learning still.</p>

<p>Next up, my poetry class. I had a hard time coming up with a first poem for the class and ended up writing about my shitty ex girlfriend. My lovely wife got mad and we fought. So in an attempt at saving face, I said, &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll write every one after about you!&rdquo; And she said &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>It was a blast too.</p>

<p>Gutten-Trollen.</p>

<p>Every new style were learned became a challenge to tell a new chapter of our lives together and it worked out very well. Then I had to write a free verse at the end of the semester. I was like &ldquo;I got this&rdquo; since, well, I write free verse. But I ended up writing 2 separate ones, in very different styles, on top of starting the first one 3 different times, jotting down lines here and there in between bouts of writer&rsquo;s block, etc. I ended up writing a 3.5 page poem much in the same vein as Ginsberg. And just about died. I realized that should I use that one, it would create a lot of bad noise, so I opted for the shorter second one, written in the style that I traditionally use. It was cute and I went with that one. I let a classmate named Jason read my longform and he cried, hit me with said poem several times, said he hated me a dozen or so times, and then said I had to read that one instead. I had the professor print copies for me last minute and read it. I didn&rsquo;t get a standing ovation but I didn&rsquo;t get much of a response aside from reading it in the rambling manner that I did, take out commas when it won&rsquo;t break things, and that it was, in fact, Ginsberg-esque. I have it on another blog so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>

<p>In the end, my plan to write everything about my wife came through and now I&rsquo;m planning on turning it into a chapbook for our anniversary. I&rsquo;m gonna see about putting it into eFormat on Kindle too. Maybe sell it for $3 a pop.</p>

<p>Programming has been an absolute disaster. We have a flat tire in our group, which is too be expected but fuck that guy. He rubs Keith and I the wrong way. hasn&rsquo;t done any checkins on TFS, acts like RAM is the key to all computer issues, acts like he know the difference from a motherboard and a skateboard, and just overall sucks to be around. He&rsquo;s black so if you say anything at all that can be taken in anyway possible as racist, he acts like you just killed and fucked his mom. It&rsquo;s the worst. Say a bit of code is ghetto, and you are making fun of his upbringing, say my name is spelled in the way that I&rsquo;ve observed is commonly spelled by black folk and I just basically told him I wish his people were still slaves. It&rsquo;s the absolute worst and I don&rsquo;t think I like it all too much. One day I jokingly said, after fucking with broken ass code for about 3 hours straight &ldquo;this is why I don&rsquo;t believe in God.&rdquo; (which isn&rsquo;t why I don&rsquo;t btw&hellip;) And he responded with the fact that I can&rsquo;t be in the same room as him, otherwise he will just have to murder me (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here). Like, what? It&rsquo;s clearing in print in the first amendment that you can believe in whatever you want, so there is a chance that you will probably, at one point or another, associate with a non-believer. AND THAT IS OK! Seriously, life will continue. The world will be just fine, fanatics will still kill people, and the US gov will still be Capitalist. Shit will be fine, my friend.</p>

<p>On top of that, I just need to survive finals week, pick up these 3 last credit hours and start my job at the USDA on the 31st of May. It&rsquo;s a contract position but I get to hack around with Raspberry Pis and Linux for 12.50/hour. I would do that in the summer for free so I guess I win?</p>

<p>Over this semester, I&rsquo;ve lost my mind, drank 3423453 bottles of whiskey, rum, beer, water. Ate ramen and ribeye, ported a roguelike written in Python over to Linux, added conditional Pebble Time Round support to a watchapp written in C, got 2 websites sort of up, and made a few friends and enemies. I removed 30+ people on FB because I don&rsquo;t like them. I found out my DM unfollowed me and instead of becoming angry about it, I had a realization that I am also an asshole. I&rsquo;m unlikeable. It made me sad and now I&rsquo;m going through a bit of depression over it. It sucks but it might finally be my moment that i can finally get off FB. It&rsquo;s just toxic and Idk if I need to help with that. I&rsquo;m famously good at trolling people on there but it&rsquo;s no longer fun. I am at a point where now I post things as satire about myself. Like, I am making fun of me for fun. I figure, I can do this and only offend me,(It&rsquo;s almost impossible to offend me)</p>

<p>Idk, I need to move on. Things are changing and I don&rsquo;t want to become a product for my children on FB. I don&rsquo;t want the gov to have access to FB&rsquo;s face recognition software so they can keep tabs on my kids. It&rsquo;s not fair to them and you never know who Uncle Touch is. I guess that is a good way to finish this. Social Media has become a means for the gov to keep tabs on everyone. the NSA is still watching. Coarse location is a way of tracking you via your phone without GPS. It is used. All the time. By FB, Sprint, TWC, NSA, and the list goes on. Cortona wants to know your location on your desktop computer and that is fucking scary. We need a revolution. We need a new internet. We need P2P,. Encryption, FOSS, freedom, and basic rights. This can&rsquo;t continue. We need better education, not just in the classrooms but on the web. you shouldn&rsquo;t be a product for Big Cable, Big Oil, Big Advert. We need our lives back and we aren&rsquo;t going to do that by putting our children on shelves on FB without their fucking consent. Stop it.</p>
