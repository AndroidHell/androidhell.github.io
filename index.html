		<p>I am currently on chapter 10 of the Hartl book with the Twitter clone and about halfway through the Etsy clone. I think for the time being I will call them TC and EC, respectively. I learned a very interesting thing about Rails sine I am working on the 2 projects in tandem. There is an easy way and a hard way in Rails.</p>

<p>I spent about 4-5 hours working through the login stuff for TC because Hartl has you do it all by hand. Now, that covers the gambit. Logging in, logging out, signing up, etc. It also covers form validation which is a very important aspect of web apps and sites in today&rsquo;s current state of internet. We don&rsquo;t yet have an internet ID we can use for everything. Maybe an internet driver&rsquo;s licence will be a future project.</p>

<p>So Hartl grinds it out the old fashioned way, and mind you, Rails is fairly stream-lined compared to ASP.NET or other MVC environments that I am aware of. But the Udemy video tutorial guy is awesomely lazy and is like, there&rsquo;s a gem that handles all the logging in. You just gotta grab it, bundle install, and the configure the gem for your application. After that, it creates all the routes for you and it&rsquo;s a matter of plugging the routes into the forms you build from scratch. And I mean you can barely even call that &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;About&quot;, pages_about_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;Contact&quot;, pages_contact_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>is all you really need to do. The gem has already built the pages that those pieces of code link to. It&rsquo;s very elegant to say the least. All that you really need to do is some CSS/Bootstrap-y magic to get it looking nice.</p>

<p>I still got some more understanding definitely and I don&rsquo;t think I will ever fully know all of it, but at least I am getting to the point where I can crate something usable. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up the chapter I&rsquo;m currently on on the EC project in the morning. I think I&rsquo;m going to relax tonight and play some video games. I recently picked up Papo &amp; Yo and it is one of the most endearing and sad puzzle games I have ever played. I think I already figured out the overarching story/tone based on the little dedication splash right before you start playing. Sad subject but interesting that the developer got out his emotions in such a unique way. I would have just written a shitty poem and cries a little.</p>

		<p>Intro first? My name is Derrick Shaw. I am 32 years old and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. Or rather, this is intended to be an ongoing documenting of thoughts as I work on my webapp project. This doc is sort of my &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; opposite the machine code side of things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m, is some ways, becoming an accidental programmer. I never planned on learning how to develop software, and honestly, wanted to be an IT specialist. A TL;DR of how I got here:</p>

<blockquote><p>I fucked up a lot in my 20&rsquo;s. I spent the entire time drinking and doing softcore drugs. Mainly gas station speed and marijuana. I skipped out on going to college after high school because I thought I could make a living in the factories. Well, the factories fell when the economy did and I was out of a job. Jumped around in temp jobs for a while, moved to AZ, fucked that up, moved back to IN, lived in my parent&rsquo;s basement in an alcohol-induced haze for a few months, then moved to TX after meeting my now wife.
Her family outed me for the loser that I was and at some point between working at a local gas station and a local Taco Bell at the age of 27, I decided I needed to fix myself.
I went to a revolving door 9 month-degree-type college that was more of a storefront racket to make money off of the poverty-stricken inner-city community. Joke on them was, I learned a shit ton about computers in the process. Problem being, the piece of paper they called a diploma waasn&rsquo;t taken seriously in the field I was intending to go into.
So I went to an actual college. On Day 0, I told the adviser I wanted to work on computer networks for a living and she figured that meant Computer Science. I found out real fast that I wasn&rsquo;t cut out to be a math/computer nerd. Talked to a man about picking my next semester classes and told him about the horrible professor I had who tried teaching me Python like the Nazis tried teaching the french about real estate. The man, who became known as Dr. Babb/Babb-arooni/Babb-alicious/The Babbs/etc pulled me over to Computer Information Systems, which is fancy speak for web design and software development.
I&rsquo;m 1 year away from graduating now and Babb has taken a liking to me via my dedication and hard-working demeanor.  I still don&rsquo;t know very much about programming but I do what I need to survive.
I got offered an internship this summer and it is in software development. The company uses Ruby on Rails and Java for most of what they do. I have little knowledge in Java and zero in Rails at the point of my hiring.
And here we are. So when you have barely an understanding of programming and very little knowledge of Java, save for what you did in your free time in app development for Android, and you have absolutely zero knowledge of Ruby or Rails, what do you do?  You build a social media site, that&rsquo;s what. What surprised me about myself is that in other situations, I would start a thing, get a barebones understanding, and then stop. But what I did differently this time is I created a framework for a potentially living, breathing system, on the net. This gives me an obligation to see it through.</p></blockquote>

<p>I must be blunt at this point. I am working through Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Rails Tutorial book at <a href="www.railstutorial.org">https://www.railstutorial.org</a> so my idea isn&rsquo;t wholly original. What is original is where I plan on expanding. Well, that too is a lie. I will be borrowing from the best pieces of the most popular social media sites to create what I hope to be a good social experience. I also want to keep out all the annoying things that keep people from enjoying social media. (e.g., games ads, spam, paid features, etc.)</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas and I will share them as they start to see daylight but for now, I wanted to use this space on the net as sort of a way for me to get my thoughts out when they happen, or more specifically, when I get the chance.</p>

<p>In the future, this may very well become my developmental cliffnotes, but for now, let&rsquo;s just mark this up as a personal journal as I struggle though the world of social media development.</p>

<p>I will link to the site once Alpha hits. I will also come up with a version numbering and naming scheme before then. Alphas will probably be numbers 0.0.x and Betas will be 0.x.x but I haven&rsquo;t decided on a name scheme. For now it is just going by Project Kwikr, which is very obviously a mutation of the word &lsquo;quicker&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I recently stumbled upon a few code snippets for streamlining my github activities, expecially with Ruby and Jekyll</p>

<p>This one is helpfull for deploying a Jekyll or even a Ruby project to GitHub pages. It adds all files, commits with a timestamp, integrates, generates the blog files, and pushes it up to github:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/f64123058be1f84a3379.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>...

# append this to your rakefile and simply type &quot;rake blog&quot; for full deployment process
desc &quot;Generate website, add, commit and deploy&quot;
task :blog do
    system &quot;git add .&quot;
    message = &quot;Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}&quot;
    system &quot;git commit -am \&quot;#{message}\&quot;&quot;
    Rake::Task[:integrate].execute
    Rake::Task[:generate].execute
    system &quot;git push origin source&quot;
    Rake::Task[:deploy].execute
end

...</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This following one is helpfull for a quick automated pus hto github. I like t ocall these courtosy flushes:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/430fc8db653de052a6cb.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>...

# append this to your rakefile to add autopushing
desc &quot;pushes to git with commit&quot;
task :push do
    system &quot;git add .&quot;
    message = &quot;Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}&quot;
    system &quot;git commit -am \&quot;#{message}\&quot;&quot;
    system &quot;git push origin source&quot; # or &quot;git push origin master&quot;
end

...</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>You can change the commands to whatever you want but as is, run the first by typing &ldquo;rake blog&rdquo; and the second by &ldquo;rake push&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you add these to the bottom of the Rakefile in your project they should work out of the box.</p>

<p>The above linked to my github gists and the below is inline markdown. I really jsut did htis to learn how for future reasons.</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s Friday again. Made it through another week. One of my last at FP actually. Fridays at Financial Payments, over the duration of my internship have usually been fairly laid back. We do a breakfast thing and lately Kin has been promoting watching TedTalk videos or similar things to create a discussion over foodstuff. It&rsquo;s been enjoyable to engage in the talks since it&rsquo;s about stuff that a lot of people I know either don&rsquo;t understand or just mark it up as a &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo; type thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I found a game last night that is losely based on DnD called Sword Coast Legends on Steam. Shared it with the Linux gaming community on reddit and am now starting to understand why it has mixed reviews. A redditor suggested I check out Neverwinter Nights instead. It can be ran natively on Linux but as the game is 13 years old, I can&rsquo;t find anything substantial in the way of running it and the GOG site says it only supports Windows. I have found stuff that said it runs better in Wine/PoL on Linux then natively on Windows so that is cool. I might check it out.</p>

<p>The weekend is gonna be busy. Tonight I need to put up the Christmas tree. Tomorrow we need to do gift shopping since the family is doing Christams earlier this year. Tomorrow evening the wife and I are supposed to play pool but I might talk her into Star Wars Ep. 7 instead. Postpone pool for another week.</p>

<p>Sunday we need to go grocery shopping and wrap gifts. I&rsquo;m hoping to talk to Alan at church about a sock drive as well. I&rsquo;ve been putting tha toff for 2 weeks now and it&rsquo;s pretty much winter at this point.</p>

<p>Other than that, I need to stay off of social media until I see SW. People ruin everything.</p>

		<p>So first thing is first. I need to finish the about page for this thing.</p>

<p>On to business though. I think I can see myself using this to get my thoughts out. I really do like the hacky feeling of using cli and an ide in order to create blog posts instead of a wysiwyg.</p>

<p>I donno if I can post on a daily basis but it would be nice to use this as a sort of personal journal to see how things progress.</p>

<p>I can leave my America: The Shit Show blog as is instead of converting it over to this format. That space will be better suited for just typing things out, where this will be better suited for techy stuff.</p>

<p>Which is what I suppose it was initially meant for.</p>

<p>Before I do the tech stuff tho&hellip;</p>

<p>News Years Resolution idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be nicer to my enemies</li>
<li>drink less</li>
<li>focus on a single group of languages and actually focus on code logic (I&rsquo;ve been all over the place this year. [See: Pounds to Babies converter written in PHP])</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff</li>
<li>Quit being politically loud on social media (change out the Hitler Trump Twitter pic)</li>
<li>155 lbs goal</li>
<li>take more photos. Hopefully the photography class will light that fire</li>
<li>Get a damn job. Anyone need websites made?</li>
<li>think of more things</li>
</ul>


<p>The list will be altered before the year is out. My main focus on the next year is to just avoid dickish people and to not be, myself, dickish. I&rsquo;m going to help out more too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s looking like the web design business is not picking up and isn&rsquo;t at all where I was hoping it would be at this point. I&rsquo;m waiting out these next few weeks at FP and then I donno what I&rsquo;m going to do after that.</p>

<p>I might sleep until school starts again. Maybe play some games. I&rsquo;m in the middle of Deponia and it makes me feel dumb. I still haven’t done my annual Half-Life-athon or Mass Effect run.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also  need to figure out how to make this octopress thing my own since it is showing that I have done 860+ commits but those are from other people. I think I need to do a manual install instead of downloading it from git through command line.</p>

		<p>This is my first post so I felt it was obvious that I should title it &ldquo;Hello World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoing to use this as my official platform for writing out my experiences in the programming world.</p>

<p>If this dies, then it dies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on setting up this site&rsquo;s styling and get a proper about me page up before I delve further into things.</p>

<p>This will aslo be a chance for me to further explore markdown since my knowledge is limited to what little I have done on github and commenting on reddit.</p>

<p>Until I have mroe to say I will leve off at this point.</p>

<p>This is my attempt a maintaining a developer space on my github via Octopress, basically because it&rsquo;s cool and all the hipsters are gonna be jealous of my hacky blog skills.</p>

<p>At that, I say, Goodbye World!</p>
