	<div class="entry-content"><p>I had started writing a blog last night but seemed to have ingested too much beer and realized I was starting some quasi-intelligent ramble but ended up on another Donald Trump rant. I deleted it as I had mentioned that I wanted to devote my blog time more to off-the-cuff stuff and I feel I’ve been ranting too much about him.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out before I move on: Trump caters to the lowest common denominator. That means that if you like him, you are the LCD. Urban Dictionary defines the LCD as the dumbass in a group of dumbasses. Both Stephen Hawking and Sam Harris has stated this. And both those people are known for their ability to think. In short, this is saying that if you follow Trump, you are dumb. Maybe not actually unintelligent, but dumb for following him. I know some educated people that are voting for him and they are outliers. Ok moving on.</p>

<p>I got formerly introduced to Sam Harris recently. I am sure I’ve heard the name in passing conversation since I discussed “The New Atheists” with a close friend a few times. I listened to the podcast of Dan Carlin’s with Harris on it and decided to switch gears to his own podcast “Waking Up.”</p>

<p>I realized in short order that we are both on the same page about a lot of stuff. I donno if he is just parroting what I’ve heard before or thought of independently but somehow we are on the same page.</p>

<p>I was enjoying the podcast until he released a previously unreleased debate between himself and Omar Aziz, a former radical Islamist. I stopped listening to it because it was just the two of them yelling at each other. The Ken Ham/Bill Nye debate had more tact than whatever this was.</p>

<p>So I’ve since moved on. I’m burning through some Freakonimics episodes until I get ready to either jump back into Carlin or Harris.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed Harris’ debate with Daniel Dennett about free will. I was lost in the sauce for some of it, as anyone might have guessed. Of all the philological exercises I’ve learned of, free will will always be beyond my understanding. I got an A on that paper back in school and still have no idea about it. The podcast is a fun listen to nonetheless. I’d suggest listening to it if you can sit down for the entire session since it’s hard to get back into the material. At least it was for me.</p>

<p>So where do I go from here, this “life after Trump”? I mean I know it ain’t over but at least the rest of the ride will be for the lulz. I like this current overload of new and revisited information that I’ve been doing so I’m gonna continue in that direction. I’ll follow up with this when I have had a moment to develop ideas about it.</p>

<p>In other news, I did some programming soul searching and have chosen to focus on Python until something changes. Keeping in mind that I’m not a good programmer, I will say this. The language is fairly easy to get into and since it’s syntactically minimalistic, it’s very conducive to learning new concepts about writing code. It’s a language that is 30 years old and doesn’t have a switch statement. That is programming survival of the fittest right there.</p>

<p>My reasoning behind choosing it are as follows; I’ve been using it at work lately since most of the Raspberry Pi project is done in Python. I’ve also been doing a few smaller projects on the side that is in Python. The one thing I’ve done that wasn’t was a watch app that I did in JavaScript since the watch can only run apps written in Objective C and JavaScript. I would have done it in ObjC since it’s less resource hungry but I know a bit of JS and almost no ObjC. I might rewrite it down the road but ClayJS was released recently and I want to check it out as well. Back to Python, another reason is that it’s the language that I started my journey with so I feel that it is suitable to end a chapter in my life by focusing on Python.</p>

<p>So while everyone is shooting each other and we have to decide on Clinton or Trump for president of the free world, I’m gonna just become a recluse and hide in my apartment and work on Python skills.</p>

<p>I think this is a good stopping point since the other stuff I wanted to write about is a handful of non sequiturs.</p>
