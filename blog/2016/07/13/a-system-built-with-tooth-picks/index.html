	<div class="entry-content"><p>I like to listen to music when I write sometimes. When I wrote poetry a few generations of poems ago, I would listen to jazz as I felt that is what I needed to tap into my secret beatnik past. I&rsquo;m listening to a guilty-pleasure band now called Black Tongue. They are a novelty band of sorts. Down Tempo is a genre some people place on them. I&rsquo;d like to think they are the spiritual successors to an ill-fated genre of yore called Sludge Core or Sludge Metal. The like consists of unclean, usually nasally vocals coupled with very low tuned guitars with heavy chugging riffs and drums that are at once angry, dramatic and painfully slow. It&rsquo;s like listening to a normal heavier jsut-below-the-surface band but slowed down. Like you are high on some good weed or something. In any case I digress.</p>

<p>The system is corrupt! Raise your hand if you just heard the news. No? Nobody? Ok, I&rsquo;ll segway into the first possible topic I want to write about tonight.</p>

<p><strong>WHY I VOTED FOR THE BOOGY MAN</strong></p>

<p>This election season was a first for a lot of millennials. This election season was a good waking point for a lot of people. This was the first time I am aware that we had 2 anti-establishment candidates running. And both had a good chance of winning. Arguably, one still does. I have been a rabble-rouser for the majority of my life. I like disrupting the normal order of things whenever I can get the chance.  So when we had a rabble-rouser or two running, I started paying attention. This election, there was a candidate running that had the potential to really shake shit up in the Capital. Bernie Sander&rsquo;s now cult following was scary for most of the establishment. Much in the same way Trump is scary to educated people in and around the US.</p>

<p>I liked a lot of what Benie was spouting, not just because I was/am a student and there was a chance that I wouldn&rsquo;t end up paying a fuck ton of money for an education that should be pennies on the dollar should we have any hope for our country to continue as leaders in the sciences and maths, and not because I wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by his tax bracket switheroos. And of course, almost everyone reading this now or even in the4 future would have dodged that bullet. But I liked that he was a crazy, old Jew that came from nothing, had nothing and yet still manage to fight for the common good and equality of the country every chance he got. He has no money, he follows socialism in a pure form, and his stage presence probably helped a bit.</p>

<p>But, and this is a big BUT:</p>

<p>The reason I voted for the boogy man is because he wasn&rsquo;t Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.</p>

<p>And that is why I will be voting for Gary Johnson. I don&rsquo;t even know any of his stances on anything. But he isn&rsquo;t Hillary or Donald.</p>

<p>So we won&rsquo;t get our socialist president. It&rsquo;s ok. Sanders did a disservice for a lot of his anti-establishment follows when he publicly announced he is backing Hillary. It took the whole movement back a few years. The noise is gone now. The tide is receding and those who were angry enough to do anything are now playing Pokemon Go. Sanders is done and now we can only welcome either the Criminal or the Fraud with open arms.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Socialism/Anti-establishment movement should be over. Whether it actually is, I&rsquo;m unsure of jsut yet. Black Lives Matters is still relatively strong, even after the police shooting. And they are very much anti-establishment. I just wish they could organize enough to know who the real bad guy is. We, the AE/S folks are on their side. I am, for one a major supporter of unadulterated equal rights. I can&rsquo;t call myself any one label since I am personally wanting of equality for all. It&rsquo;s a tough fight in a nation dividing by every new bit of news anymore.</p>

<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t bode well if Trump becomes president. I know the loud ones are few and far between, and I know most of them are uneducated and don&rsquo;t really have any real means of shaking things up. I know this because I had an argument with one one time and he responded to my open acceptance of Socialism by saying &ldquo;If you love Socialism so much, why don&rsquo;t you move to North Korea?&rdquo; I paraphrased as to use proper grammar. But I was floored by this comment. Have you ever lost an argument that you were right on? It&rsquo;s a weird thing to say the least.</p>

<p>Hillary is bought and paid for. AT&amp;T put over $5 million in her pocket, big oil is in her bed and as was shown to us. the fucking FBI won&rsquo;t even do anything to hinder her chance in the white house. A meme came around a few weeks ago comparing Hillary to Edward Snowden. Snowden in an absolute hero for uncovering the illegal activities that the government was engaging in and he is now in exile. Hillary did something on the same level and is probably getting a seat in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Then there is Trump. He has been talking for an entire year and hasn&rsquo;t said a single thing. Well, he has said stuff. He usually just spouts off racial slurs and basically acts like a complete bigot on stage and the anti-intellectualists eat it right up. He speaks to the lowest denominator and those in turn get the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; to live vicariously through him. How did I would this before&hellip; His supporters are ok with living a wee bit above poverty because they are told that if they work hard all their lives, they will rise a little bit on the societal ladder before they die and they use Trump as some sort of  Golden Idol to get them to crawl through the shit each day.</p>

<p>Its weird.</p>

<p> To be continued&hellip;</p>
