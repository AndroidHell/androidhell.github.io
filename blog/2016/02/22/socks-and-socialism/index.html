	<div class="entry-content"><p>I sometimes think to hard on a subject so when I get around to wanting to write it, I&rsquo;ve at least mentally moved on. I&rsquo;ve never liked this about myself, because at least from a philosophical standpoint, my ideas help define me. They help me progress as a human and going back and looking at how I was at a given time allows me to understand myself better.</p>

<p>For example, barely over a decade ago, I used to be a very loud and proud atheist. I was very vocal about how awesome it was to not believe in a god. I was very up front about how believing in one made you stupid. I look back on that and realize how far I have come. I&rsquo;m always trying to be a better person, regardless of faith, education, or social status. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve started on a journey of trying to give back. It&rsquo;s hard but it can change you forever, when you get to that point where you can help and do it humbly. I never want a “thank you” from what I do but it&rsquo;s always nice to hear.</p>

<p>For almost a year now, I&rsquo;ve been helping in the kitchen at the in-law&rsquo;s church&rsquo;s Prayer Breakfast. We offer a warm breakfast for people who are homeless or in poverty. And really, anyone can come who wants a free meal. It&rsquo;s abundantly clear that we don&rsquo;t care where you come form.</p>

<p>On a side note, I remember a while back hearing a gentleman there telling someone that they don&rsquo;t even believe in God, they just show up for he free food. Guess what guy? That&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t believe either. I don&rsquo;t do this because God wants me to. I do this because I want to.</p>

<p>I was going to write about the success of our sock drive last week but got busy. School, wife, DnD, BuffTeks, and writing a video game, watchapp, whatever, tends to get in the way sometime. So on to the sock drive.</p>

<p>I gave up counting how many we ended up with after 1,077 pairs. We personally bought 4 packs of 10 pair. If we stick to handing out 2 pair per person, that ends up being enough for 20 people, and we gathered over 1 thousand. That&rsquo;s enough for 500 people. Only a bit more then 200 people showed up and pizza/bingo and we handed out a bit less per head. We still have a lot of socks left and Mark and I were worried about not getting enough. That blows my mind. Central always calls themselves a body, but they act more like a machine. They are brutally efficient at helping out the community. I wish more people were like that.</p>

<p>My next plan is hopefully going to be bigger, but it&rsquo;s still early in it&rsquo;s infancy while we try to figure out how to hand out the rest of these socks. I want to open a public garden for anyone who wants to harvest vegetables for free. When you look at the price of vegetables in the grocery store versus the price of seeds, it just makes sense that fruit and vegetables should move into a socialistic product. I don&rsquo;t have the math done right now but I can promise that the cost of planting seeds and watering plants is virtually free in the scheme of feeding the hungry. The only issues is finding land and finding people who will donate their time. America is Capitalistic by nature so Social Economics will be extremely hard to pull off even at this scale. I mean I can see people doing it for a short term but I want this to be sustainable as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet future blogs on this platform will start becoming more Socialistic in nature. I feel that is where my life is heading. I want to explore Socialism and this garden might be a good chance. The socks were.</p>

<p>That leads me to a idea that came from a discussion with my wife. She feels that people should give of their own accord, and I feel that they won&rsquo;t. The only people that generally give are religions people. And the church is getting smaller. Non-beleivers don&rsquo;t help by nature&rsquo;s design. A lot of believers only help reluctantly. The country isn&rsquo;t set up for social economics yet, but it could work. It does work. I almost think it might even happen naturally. Automation is going to change our entire existence. It&rsquo;s going to displace millions of workers decades at a time. A curious number suggests that in just 6 decades, we will see a global unemployment of 50%. conservatives say we will see new jobs, but I venture a guess that we will lose jobs a hell of a lot faster then we will gain. New jobs won&rsquo;t matter. If we lose these jobs to automation, and if longevity of life continues to increase, we are going to have to come up with some sort of alternative to the workforce. We need an alternative means to survival. Free food should be an option for survival.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost time for America to rethink what freedom is. It isn&rsquo;t living under the umbrella of materialism as a luxury. I deserve freedom and so do you. Hard work for money is a fleeting idea. It&rsquo;s time to move to a new economic existence where everyone is equal, regardless of their parents. It&rsquo;s time to remove social status. It&rsquo;s time to fix where our money goes.</p>
