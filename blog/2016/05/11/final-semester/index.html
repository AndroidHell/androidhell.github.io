<p>What happens now? I just finished wrapping up my last CIDM class and everything else is in order. I have one more class to take over the summer but I do get to walk on Saturday. So there is that. I&rsquo;m also finishing my entire college career with A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s because I tried.</p>

<p>So what now? I have a job lined up with the USDA but I also got a phone call from a staffing agency that needed a web developer position filled. After some sleuthing, it turns out that it was not a scam but there was just some oppsies with emails. That position offers twice what USDA is offering in the way of pay. Both jobs are temporary, but the web dev one is temp-to-hire. If they offer it to me, I kind of gotta take it but then I&rsquo;d be letting down the USDA folks who sent me an unofficial offer email the other day.</p>

<p>Then there was the web dev job for CSI that fell through but they still have a position opened that Babb mentioned today so I sent him an email that said toss my name in and let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll fill you in once I know what the hell is going on. I&rsquo;m gonna cut this short since I wanted to get started on re-learning PHP. I was gonna wait until next week but if not now, then never. Right?</p>
