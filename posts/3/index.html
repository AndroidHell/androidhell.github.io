		<p>The weekend is over and it was fairly busy. I spent Friday with the wife putting the tree up. Did the gift shopping on Saturday and got most stuff wrapped on yesterday. Went to church and talked to Alan and Mark L. about doing the sock drive and as it stands, we are looking at doing it on a dinner night on Feb 13. Announcements will be put in the bulletin.</p>

<p>Things I still need to do before the month is out: I need to get the old blogspot blog shut down. Might just leave it and let it rot on the digital vine, tbh. I also need to continue on my series on the WP blog. I&rsquo;m considering designing a POV app for Android to work with a drone if I get one for X-Mas. I have no idea where to start though.</p>

<p>I guess there isn&rsquo;t much to talk about today. I have no idea what I am going to do this week at work. It&rsquo;s really starting to drain me not having anything to do and just letting the next 2 weeks run out like this. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a new web project to work on until then. I donno  what though. All my next project ideas would be better suited for home.</p>

<p>My brother bought me Wither 2 for X-Mas. I was reluctant to grab it since it&rsquo;s an eON port but after testing Bioshock: Infinite at medium settings and it running fine, I decided to add W2 to my wishlist. Then he bought it. It&rsquo;s more his game but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying it so far.</p>

<p>Donno what else to say.</p>

		<p>The Magic Panel</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost done with the rails tutorial and think I have a plan for the app itself. I want to offer it to empeopled.com as a sort of self-contained friend-feed. I was struck by just how close the community was when I was helping a user tweak his Chrome extension for the site. I&rsquo;ll probably post about that when/if he ever gets it to github. He said he wants to work out the kinks before he feels it&rsquo;s ready for the public to use. He wants the features fleshed out.</p>

<p>With that said, I made a thing. It&rsquo;s still a bit clunky but it does what I think it is supposed to so let&rsquo;s call this an impromptu guide on said thing. So, I like Bootstraps responsive navbar, and I like making it a sidebar instead. I also like having a sticky side-panel and the news feed on the other side. In Bootstrap speak, you have your core profile info in a md-col-4 and the actual news feed in a md-col-8. The sidebar won&rsquo;t move but the feed will on mouse scroll. The catch is that you maintain Bootstrap&rsquo;s responsive behavior all the while. It got real tricky, real fast. Let&rsquo;s jump in, shall we?</p>

<p>The hard part first: I have all my Javascript in a file called extras.js so I can keep track of my own JS and keep it separate from the stuff required/generated for Rails. The full JS file is as follow:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This uses some JQuery magic to affix whatever I use the #MyNav on it&rsquo;s div. It&rsquo;s similar to using static versus fixed in CSS. but it works with the responsive nature of the site.  So we tuck that into the extras.js file and move on to our HTML which will be the easier part:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;row&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;aside</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;col-md-4&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-spy=</span><span class="s">&quot;affix&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-offset-top=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- side panel goes here v--&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/aside&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;col-md-8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- page content goes here --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we have the md-col-4 and md-col-8 that I mentioned earlier. Bootstrap uses these to segregate the content for your own amusement and manipulation. Our profile content goes in the -4 and our feed, in the -8. Once we have the Bootstrap logic set up, we can then add our bit of JQuery to the HTML with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-spy=</span><span class="s">&quot;affix&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-offset-top=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> This added the affix function along with a data-offset function that we set to &ldquo;0&rdquo; to keep the div in the same place when we scroll. If you set it to another number it will be positioned differently. On some monitors/browsers, you may notice the div flicker on scroll and occasionally it will scroll and catch and with that said, this isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it does work.</p>

<p>The final bit of magic is using 2 Bootstrap media queries for the separate screen sizes. This bit was hard to get right and took an hour or two of tinkering and crashing my virtual server on Cloud 9 several times. When you spam edit/save the CSS it loads the RAM and then it takes a shit. It&rsquo;s a limit of having a server with only 512 MB of RAM for a dev environment I guess. Anyway, the CSS:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>We start by setting a fixed width for the .affix class because it will resize on scroll otherwise. I never figured out why it naturally wants to change the entire section&rsquo;s size but it does so we fix it to the same width of the &lt;aside&gt; and it stays put. We then add two important media queries that will keep things at a correct spot on different screen sizes. The goal was to have a side-panel for most/all computer screens but go into a single column on tablet and mobile screens.
The first query looks like I arbitrarily used 293px but I came up with that after a series of trials and errors of resizing the browser until it behaved properly. This is for smaller desktop/laptop screens. The second query is for going into a single column, indicated by width: 100%; for both the .affix and .micropost classes.</p>

<p>Now that we have all the pieces in place, you should have a functioning responsive-fixed-hybrid page along with all your other Bootstrappy magic.</p>

<p>The only real caveat here is that if you are using Turbolinks/Jquery-Turbolinks, the scripts won&rsquo;t work unless you reload the entire page. As, the saying goes, that just isn&rsquo;t the Rails way. We have a full site built on _partials and all sorts of modular pieces and we haven&rsquo;t come this far to get hung up by a stupid page refresh. The onl solution I found to fix Javascript stopping on a link click was to remove the Turbolinks and JQuery-Turbolinks  gems altogether including deleting them from application.js. The other fixes I found didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, this was my attempt at a guide. Sorry about any confusion ahead of time. Happy coding!</p>

		<p>Errors. Errors everywhere.</p>

<p>As I was working through the TC stuff last night and finishing up user validation and testing whether users could masquerade as other users, I stumbled headlong into what I will call my 3rd bug hell of this project. The problem with being human is that you are incredibly prone to error. It&rsquo;s in our very nature to screw stuff up. It&rsquo;s that deciding factor that will forever separate us from machines. Sure some machines break down but that&rsquo;s just poor design or manufacturing by a human more than it is wear and tear. (There is still a measurable amount of w&amp;t in machinery, I know but it&rsquo;s not as significant as , say a DOA hard drive from an oversight or mistake made by the person running the hard drive making machines.)</p>

<p>I digress. I was working through the book code to finish the user integration testing and had a handful of errors that were easy to fix. Just had to deal with a rabbit hole of them. Then right as I was finishing the first section of chapter10, I did another &lsquo;rake test&rsquo; and hit this handful of errors that I couldn&rsquo;t even figure out what the messages were meaning. On  Cloud 9, in the terminal, you can click on the file path related to the error and tell it to open the file and it will direct you to the exact line of code. Easy enough to check on stuff. But the problem lies in the fact that even though that line might be what is erroring out, it is doing so from another bit of code that it is pulling from. Say you wrote a method and had a logical error or a typo in it. In this hypothetical, the controller using that method from your &lsquo;helper&rsquo; file would show the error. You can state at that line all day long and decide it is correct as hell, or you can follow the rabbit trail of what you just did to get there. This is where Eclipse and Visual Studio excel at because they have the function of stepping through while debugging. This is probably why I make use either Eclipse or Aptana to develop locally from now on. Or, at the very least, debug in one of those two, but keep Sublime Text as my main dev too so things stay light and crisp.</p>

<p>I worked on fighting those bugs for about 3 hours and finally figured out that I had a line of code that was logging in the user, then going into an &lsquo;if/else&rsquo; and the first thing it was doing was logging in the user again. My errors said nothing about the user being logged in twice or anything closely resembling that message. The worst part about it is that it was a simple oversight on my part. After that I was down to 1 error, which I finally found to be a typo. Cleaned that up and had another typo right after that line. Again, cleaned up and ran another test and everything came out green.</p>

<p>What annoys me is that it isn&rsquo;t as simple as saying &ldquo;Hey, this is what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s following hte trail and actually knowing your code. Make comments that tell you where this thing is coming from or going to. Make a flow chart if need be. A mechanic doesn&rsquo;t just hop under the car without knowing point A and point B of the exhaust system.</p>

<p>Errors now gone, I should be ready to set up password reset stuff, which will be a journey in itself. Then after that, we can start finally working on the main feature of the project; posting user generated content.</p>

<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m also considering calling the final project an alpha but starting from scratch and rebuilding everything based on my knowledge from both projects. I would really like to implement paperclip and devise into the TC and also redo the entire styling. I might come up with soem doodles later on on what I&rsquo;m imagining.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m skipping workout to focus on code this morning. I&rsquo;m working on EC for the time being and wanted to write a quick followup to the whole devise gem praise I gave yesterday. The gem is great for automating all your authentication needs but according to the author of the guide on Udemy, it isn&rsquo;t easy to re-style the alert messages to reflect those of actual Bootstrap. He wrote a weird bit of voodoo magic that accomplishes that.</p>

<p>He placed this bit of crazy right above the &lt;% yield %> tag that displays the pay content. Since this is in application.html.erb it will be able to function on all pages.</p>

<p>On reflection, it is really interesting that a developer can take something as complicated as authentication and form validation and wrap it up into a nice little import-able lib/gem and someone else can point out a single &ldquo;unfixable&rdquo; flaw and write some code that acts as a standalone fix.</p>

<p>EDIT: Second part of code magic. Make a new file in app/helpers/ called devise_helper.rb and add:</p>

<p>UPDATE: Fixed the applicatoin.html.erb code to show green on success and red on error. The code from the guide was for a previous version of Rails and stuff got changed and it treated a bit differently in the version I am using (v. 4.2.1).</p>

		<p>I am currently on chapter 10 of the Hartl book with the Twitter clone and about halfway through the Etsy clone. I think for the time being I will call them TC and EC, respectively. I learned a very interesting thing about Rails sine I am working on the 2 projects in tandem. There is an easy way and a hard way in Rails.</p>

<p>I spent about 4-5 hours working through the login stuff for TC because Hartl has you do it all by hand. Now, that covers the gambit. Logging in, logging out, signing up, etc. It also covers form validation which is a very important aspect of web apps and sites in today&rsquo;s current state of internet. We don&rsquo;t yet have an internet ID we can use for everything. Maybe an internet driver&rsquo;s licence will be a future project.</p>

<p>So Hartl grinds it out the old fashioned way, and mind you, Rails is fairly stream-lined compared to ASP.NET or other MVC environments that I am aware of. But the Udemy video tutorial guy is awesomely lazy and is like, there&rsquo;s a gem that handles all the logging in. You just gotta grab it, bundle install, and the configure the gem for your application. After that, it creates all the routes for you and it&rsquo;s a matter of plugging the routes into the forms you build from scratch. And I mean you can barely even call that &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;About&quot;, pages_about_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;Contact&quot;, pages_contact_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>is all you really need to do. The gem has already built the pages that those pieces of code link to. It&rsquo;s very elegant to say the least. All that you really need to do is some CSS/Bootstrap-y magic to get it looking nice.</p>

<p>I still got some more understanding definitely and I don&rsquo;t think I will ever fully know all of it, but at least I am getting to the point where I can crate something usable. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up the chapter I&rsquo;m currently on on the EC project in the morning. I think I&rsquo;m going to relax tonight and play some video games. I recently picked up Papo &amp; Yo and it is one of the most endearing and sad puzzle games I have ever played. I think I already figured out the overarching story/tone based on the little dedication splash right before you start playing. Sad subject but interesting that the developer got out his emotions in such a unique way. I would have just written a shitty poem and cries a little.</p>

		<p>Intro first? My name is Derrick Shaw. I am 32 years old and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. Or rather, this is intended to be an ongoing documenting of thoughts as I work on my webapp project. This doc is sort of my &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; opposite the machine code side of things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m, is some ways, becoming an accidental programmer. I never planned on learning how to develop software, and honestly, wanted to be an IT specialist. A TL;DR of how I got here:</p>

<blockquote><p>I fucked up a lot in my 20&rsquo;s. I spent the entire time drinking and doing softcore drugs. Mainly gas station speed and marijuana. I skipped out on going to college after high school because I thought I could make a living in the factories. Well, the factories fell when the economy did and I was out of a job. Jumped around in temp jobs for a while, moved to AZ, fucked that up, moved back to IN, lived in my parent&rsquo;s basement in an alcohol-induced haze for a few months, then moved to TX after meeting my now wife.
Her family outed me for the loser that I was and at some point between working at a local gas station and a local Taco Bell at the age of 27, I decided I needed to fix myself.
I went to a revolving door 9 month-degree-type college that was more of a storefront racket to make money off of the poverty-stricken inner-city community. Joke on them was, I learned a shit ton about computers in the process. Problem being, the piece of paper they called a diploma waasn&rsquo;t taken seriously in the field I was intending to go into.
So I went to an actual college. On Day 0, I told the adviser I wanted to work on computer networks for a living and she figured that meant Computer Science. I found out real fast that I wasn&rsquo;t cut out to be a math/computer nerd. Talked to a man about picking my next semester classes and told him about the horrible professor I had who tried teaching me Python like the Nazis tried teaching the french about real estate. The man, who became known as Dr. Babb/Babb-arooni/Babb-alicious/The Babbs/etc pulled me over to Computer Information Systems, which is fancy speak for web design and software development.
I&rsquo;m 1 year away from graduating now and Babb has taken a liking to me via my dedication and hard-working demeanor.  I still don&rsquo;t know very much about programming but I do what I need to survive.
I got offered an internship this summer and it is in software development. The company uses Ruby on Rails and Java for most of what they do. I have little knowledge in Java and zero in Rails at the point of my hiring.
And here we are. So when you have barely an understanding of programming and very little knowledge of Java, save for what you did in your free time in app development for Android, and you have absolutely zero knowledge of Ruby or Rails, what do you do?  You build a social media site, that&rsquo;s what. What surprised me about myself is that in other situations, I would start a thing, get a barebones understanding, and then stop. But what I did differently this time is I created a framework for a potentially living, breathing system, on the net. This gives me an obligation to see it through.</p></blockquote>

<p>I must be blunt at this point. I am working through Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Rails Tutorial book at <a href="www.railstutorial.org">https://www.railstutorial.org</a> so my idea isn&rsquo;t wholly original. What is original is where I plan on expanding. Well, that too is a lie. I will be borrowing from the best pieces of the most popular social media sites to create what I hope to be a good social experience. I also want to keep out all the annoying things that keep people from enjoying social media. (e.g., games ads, spam, paid features, etc.)</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas and I will share them as they start to see daylight but for now, I wanted to use this space on the net as sort of a way for me to get my thoughts out when they happen, or more specifically, when I get the chance.</p>

<p>In the future, this may very well become my developmental cliffnotes, but for now, let&rsquo;s just mark this up as a personal journal as I struggle though the world of social media development.</p>

<p>I will link to the site once Alpha hits. I will also come up with a version numbering and naming scheme before then. Alphas will probably be numbers 0.0.x and Betas will be 0.x.x but I haven&rsquo;t decided on a name scheme. For now it is just going by Project Kwikr, which is very obviously a mutation of the word &lsquo;quicker&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I recently stumbled upon a few code snippets for streamlining my github activities, expecially with Ruby and Jekyll</p>

<p>This one is helpfull for deploying a Jekyll or even a Ruby project to GitHub pages. It adds all files, commits with a timestamp, integrates, generates the blog files, and pushes it up to github:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/f64123058be1f84a3379.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>...

# append this to your rakefile and simply type &quot;rake blog&quot; for full deployment process
desc &quot;Generate website, add, commit and deploy&quot;
task :blog do
    system &quot;git add .&quot;
    message = &quot;Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}&quot;
    system &quot;git commit -am \&quot;#{message}\&quot;&quot;
    Rake::Task[:integrate].execute
    Rake::Task[:generate].execute
    system &quot;git push origin source&quot;
    Rake::Task[:deploy].execute
end

...</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This following one is helpfull for a quick automated pus hto github. I like t ocall these courtosy flushes:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/430fc8db653de052a6cb.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>...

# append this to your rakefile to add autopushing
desc &quot;pushes to git with commit&quot;
task :push do
    system &quot;git add .&quot;
    message = &quot;Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}&quot;
    system &quot;git commit -am \&quot;#{message}\&quot;&quot;
    system &quot;git push origin source&quot; # or &quot;git push origin master&quot;
end

...</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>You can change the commands to whatever you want but as is, run the first by typing &ldquo;rake blog&rdquo; and the second by &ldquo;rake push&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you add these to the bottom of the Rakefile in your project they should work out of the box.</p>

<p>-R</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s Friday again. Made it through another week. One of my last at FP actually. Fridays at Financial Payments, over the duration of my internship have usually been fairly laid back. We do a breakfast thing and lately Kin has been promoting watching TedTalk videos or similar things to create a discussion over foodstuff. It&rsquo;s been enjoyable to engage in the talks since it&rsquo;s about stuff that a lot of people I know either don&rsquo;t understand or just mark it up as a &ldquo;never gonna happen&rdquo; type thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I found a game last night that is losely based on DnD called Sword Coast Legends on Steam. Shared it with the Linux gaming community on reddit and am now starting to understand why it has mixed reviews. A redditor suggested I check out Neverwinter Nights instead. It can be ran natively on Linux but as the game is 13 years old, I can&rsquo;t find anything substantial in the way of running it and the GOG site says it only supports Windows. I have found stuff that said it runs better in Wine/PoL on Linux then natively on Windows so that is cool. I might check it out.</p>

<p>The weekend is gonna be busy. Tonight I need to put up the Christmas tree. Tomorrow we need to do gift shopping since the family is doing Christams earlier this year. Tomorrow evening the wife and I are supposed to play pool but I might talk her into Star Wars Ep. 7 instead. Postpone pool for another week.</p>

<p>Sunday we need to go grocery shopping and wrap gifts. I&rsquo;m hoping to talk to Alan at church about a sock drive as well. I&rsquo;ve been putting tha toff for 2 weeks now and it&rsquo;s pretty much winter at this point.</p>

<p>Other than that, I need to stay off of social media until I see SW. People ruin everything.</p>

		<p>So first thing is first. I need to finish the about page for this thing.</p>

<p>On to business though. I think I can see myself using this to get my thoughts out. I really do like the hacky feeling of using cli and an ide in order to create blog posts instead of a wysiwyg.</p>

<p>I donno if I can post on a daily basis but it would be nice to use this as a sort of personal journal to see how things progress.</p>

<p>I can leave my America: The Shit Show blog as is instead of converting it over to this format. That space will be better suited for just typing things out, where this will be better suited for techy stuff.</p>

<p>Which is what I suppose it was initially meant for.</p>

<p>Before I do the tech stuff tho&hellip;</p>

<p>News Years Resolution idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be nicer to my enemies</li>
<li>drink less</li>
<li>focus on a single group of languages and actually focus on code logic (I&rsquo;ve been all over the place this year. [See: Pounds to Babies converter written in PHP])</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff</li>
<li>Quit being politically loud on social media (change out the Hitler Trump Twitter pic)</li>
<li>155 lbs goal</li>
<li>take more photos. Hopefully the photography class will light that fire</li>
<li>Get a damn job. Anyone need websites made?</li>
<li>think of more things</li>
</ul>


<p>The list will be altered before the year is out. My main focus on the next year is to just avoid dickish people and to not be, myself, dickish. I&rsquo;m going to help out more too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s looking like the web design business is not picking up and isn&rsquo;t at all where I was hoping it would be at this point. I&rsquo;m waiting out these next few weeks at FP and then I donno what I&rsquo;m going to do after that.</p>

<p>I might sleep until school starts again. Maybe play some games. I&rsquo;m in the middle of Deponia and it makes me feel dumb. I still haven’t done my annual Half-Life-athon or Mass Effect run.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also  need to figure out how to make this octopress thing my own since it is showing that I have done 860+ commits but those are from other people. I think I need to do a manual install instead of downloading it from git through command line.</p>

		<p>This is my first post so I felt it was obvious that I should title it &ldquo;Hello World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoing to use this as my official platform for writing out my experiences in the programming world.</p>

<p>If this dies, then it dies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to work on setting up this site&rsquo;s styling and get a proper about me page up before I delve further into things.</p>

<p>This will aslo be a chance for me to further explore markdown since my knowledge is limited to what little I have done on github and commenting on reddit.</p>

<p>Until I have mroe to say I will leve off at this point.</p>

<p>This is my attempt a maintaining a developer space on my github via Octopress, basically because it&rsquo;s cool and all the hipsters are gonna be jealous of my hacky blog skills.</p>

<p>At that, I say, Goodbye World!</p>
