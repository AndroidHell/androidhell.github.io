      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new Chapter, for me usually means I moved somewhere or I did some other glorious thingy. In this case, we moved to Amarillo. We are still in the “woes of unpacking” stage where you sometimes mindlessly dump a box all over the place in hopes that the bits and pieces on the inside end up where you want them to go.</p>

<p>We now reside in a very held-together-with-glue-and-tooth-picks duplex next to a nice couple. He’s Hispanic and she’s white and they are adorable together. He thinks I’m the smartest thing on the planet and I tried explaining that I’m more diligent than smart. He still doesn’t believe it. I know a lot of shit, doesn’t means I’m genius material. More on that maybe in the future.</p>

<p>I’m currently sipping on a Bloody Mary, which is totally outside my element. I.E, it’s not beer. It’s good though. The V8 is spiked with sea salt and clam juice. Nice and rustic.I’d recommend this concoction to any foodie.</p>

<p>Work is still work. Today was a “Field Day” which means all the scientists were busy so I was left to my own devises. I worked on the prototype of my little 3D printed Pi box and spent the second part of the day rewriting my watch app I spun up a few months back in a hasty mess of code. I redid everything and went with the “%H:$M:%S” jazz that was suggested by a colleague. It’s a lot less code and still does the same thing so that is cool. Bonus points for lazy. I wish they spent more time on that concept in school. I did the original version in this barbaric math logic bullshit. It was just a messy piece of shit.</p>

<p>I think that’s all I got for now. No real political rants since it’s all beating dead horses by now. I’m not sure if I still stand by my Johnson vote at this point. I’d rather not have Trump since he will only leave the nation worse off then it is now. Clinton is still meh, but an actual politician, so she knows how the play the game. Idk, in any scenario I feel like I’m throwing my vote away. It’s sad. This isn’t democracy.</p>

<p>In any case, here’s to a new chapter. New 3 bedroom, 1.5bathroom duplex. Ready for baby makin’. I guess that will be the next chapter.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had started writing a blog last night but seemed to have ingested too much beer and realized I was starting some quasi-intelligent ramble but ended up on another Donald Trump rant. I deleted it as I had mentioned that I wanted to devote my blog time more to off-the-cuff stuff and I feel I’ve been ranting too much about him.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out before I move on: Trump caters to the lowest common denominator. That means that if you like him, you are the LCD. Urban Dictionary defines the LCD as the dumbass in a group of dumbasses. Both Stephen Hawking and Sam Harris has stated this. And both those people are known for their ability to think. In short, this is saying that if you follow Trump, you are dumb. Maybe not actually unintelligent, but dumb for following him. I know some educated people that are voting for him and they are outliers. Ok moving on.</p>

<p>I got formerly introduced to Sam Harris recently. I am sure I’ve heard the name in passing conversation since I discussed “The New Atheists” with a close friend a few times. I listened to the podcast of Dan Carlin’s with Harris on it and decided to switch gears to his own podcast “Waking Up.”</p>

<p>I realized in short order that we are both on the same page about a lot of stuff. I donno if he is just parroting what I’ve heard before or thought of independently but somehow we are on the same page.</p>

<p>I was enjoying the podcast until he released a previously unreleased debate between himself and Omar Aziz, a former radical Islamist. I stopped listening to it because it was just the two of them yelling at each other. The Ken Ham/Bill Nye debate had more tact than whatever this was.</p>

<p>So I’ve since moved on. I’m burning through some Freakonimics episodes until I get ready to either jump back into Carlin or Harris.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed Harris’ debate with Daniel Dennett about free will. I was lost in the sauce for some of it, as anyone might have guessed. Of all the philological exercises I’ve learned of, free will will always be beyond my understanding. I got an A on that paper back in school and still have no idea about it. The podcast is a fun listen to nonetheless. I’d suggest listening to it if you can sit down for the entire session since it’s hard to get back into the material. At least it was for me.</p>

<p>So where do I go from here, this “life after Trump”? I mean I know it ain’t over but at least the rest of the ride will be for the lulz. I like this current overload of new and revisited information that I’ve been doing so I’m gonna continue in that direction. I’ll follow up with this when I have had a moment to develop ideas about it.</p>

<p>In other news, I did some programming soul searching and have chosen to focus on Python until something changes. Keeping in mind that I’m not a good programmer, I will say this. The language is fairly easy to get into and since it’s syntactically minimalistic, it’s very conducive to learning new concepts about writing code. It’s a language that is 30 years old and doesn’t have a switch statement. That is programming survival of the fittest right there.</p>

<p>My reasoning behind choosing it are as follows; I’ve been using it at work lately since most of the Raspberry Pi project is done in Python. I’ve also been doing a few smaller projects on the side that is in Python. The one thing I’ve done that wasn’t was a watch app that I did in JavaScript since the watch can only run apps written in Objective C and JavaScript. I would have done it in ObjC since it’s less resource hungry but I know a bit of JS and almost no ObjC. I might rewrite it down the road but ClayJS was released recently and I want to check it out as well. Back to Python, another reason is that it’s the language that I started my journey with so I feel that it is suitable to end a chapter in my life by focusing on Python.</p>

<p>So while everyone is shooting each other and we have to decide on Clinton or Trump for president of the free world, I’m gonna just become a recluse and hide in my apartment and work on Python skills.</p>

<p>I think this is a good stopping point since the other stuff I wanted to write about is a handful of non sequiturs.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>I LIED</strong></p>

<p>Ok so let&rsquo;s explore this RNG theory of mine before I decide on a proper name. And then maybe I can start into something else I have been wanting to write about.</p>

<p>So the podcast with Harris and Dennett uses a scenario involving Tiger Woods where he has a 999 out of 1000 chance of getting a golf ball in on a 2 foot put. And for some reason, he misses. They go into why he missed and whether it was up to some predetermined event or if he just partied to hard the night before. They even add a bird chirping at the right moment that took him out of the zone. Dennett eludes to the bird being a random event but I begot differ since a golf course is surrounded by trees and birds live in trees so chances are, there are birds. But I do get his point.</p>

<p>What I propose is that the two elements work together in a tug of war and can be manipulated. Well, free will can be manipulated which can change determinism. Ugh&hellip; Let&rsquo;s try this:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are on vacation in Vegas with your spouse. The vacation and location has been planned and everything is known ahead of time. So we will rule out any smartypants thinking there. Let&rsquo;s say however, that you like to gamble and your spouse doesn&rsquo;t like you to do so. Gambling in itself is innately random so that is why I chose this example. Let&rsquo;s say you promise you won&rsquo;t play poker at the casino that your hotel is connected to.</p>

<p>But you have a fight and after a few beers, you storm out of the hotel room and just start walking. You end up at the front doorway of the casino and figure, screw it, and you go in and pay for some chips, find a table and set down.</p>

<p>What is free will and what is per-determined? You have to follow the events to find out what is determined but what if a random even, or a series of them changes the destined outcome.</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t fight, you would have less of a chance or relapsing and gambling. Maybe we should include actually staying at the hotel with the casino connected.</p>

<p>Maybe the spouse deliberately challenged you to gamble.</p>

<p>so we have forces manipulating an otherwise uneventful situation.</p>

<p>You can choose not to gamble and you have, let&rsquo;s say a usually 1 in 4 chances of gambling due to your addiction. Let&rsquo;s say, frustration and fighting with your spouse raises that to 1 in 2 chances. a 50% chance is relatively common. If you&rsquo;ve played RNG-based video games you can agree.</p>

<p>So is the fight predetermined? What if you know you can avoid a fight? Did you start the fight of free will in order to gamble?</p>

<p>What if there are too many chances for either free will or determinism to be the right answer, I guess, is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at. What if there is an element of randomness involved?</p>

<p>This is, of course, assuming that we have actual RNG and not pseudo-RNG based on a computer-calculated seed.</p>

<p>I am officially more confused than when I started&hellip;</p>

<p>To be continued???</p>

<p>PS: I forgot what the other part I was gonan write about was suppsoed to be&hellip;</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is it just determinism?</strong></p>

<p>I may have eluded to this a few posts ago but I had a bit of a tweet-fest a few weeks ago concerning the idea of why we should stop learning new things. I did my stint  at college and I should just stop reading new things or tinkering with a new programming language? Why? Just today at work I spent time playing with yet another library for Python that adds another new facet to a always impressive arsenal of tools that is Python. Python is simple as a language but it&rsquo;s extensibility is almost unmatched save for maybe JavaScript, and I blame the hipsters for that. Angular? Do we really need another stack guys?</p>

<p>Spent today playing with a GUI toolkit for Python called Tkinter. It&rsquo;s basically a whole library full of all the things you need to make the elements you see on a standards desktop OS window. Window decorations, buttons, text fields, sliders, radios, etc. It&rsquo;s like QT&rsquo;s distant, clunkier cousin. I say this only because QT has a IDE and Tkinter doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I spent today breaking windows and sifting through debug garbage while trying to get functional buttons. I&rsquo;m also trying(READ: failing) to get a nested terminal CLI to spit out terminal data as if you were running everything from CLI to begin with. It&rsquo;s not going well.</p>

<p>I also finished the podcast of Sam Harris' and Danial Dennett&rsquo;s barroom debate. I was happy that they finished it as the gentlemen I&rsquo;d like to think they are even though they disagreed with each other the entire time. It&rsquo;s weird reading two of the 4 horsemen, as they are referred to as, discuss the same thing, which they agree on, and yet, all the while disagreeing with each other. The discussion was intense and at times over my head.</p>

<p>After that I started a series from the same podcast where Harris is dissecting his most recent book since a lot of people apparently wanted to lynch him over it. I&rsquo;m halfway through the first part but from what I gather, he&rsquo;s trying to cover his ass but explaining that when he was discussing Muslims, he was intending to mean the radical militant ones and not ALL MUSLIMS. He explained that he thought his listeners understood that he was referencing Islamists and not Religion of Peace Muslims. I&rsquo;m curious about the book but probably won&rsquo;t read it. And Harris says that the audio version doesn&rsquo;t even paint him in the right light. I donno. I&rsquo;ll just take his word for it for now as I&rsquo;m just now diving into the New Atheist philosophy stuff.</p>

<p>I definitely can&rsquo;t defend anything they discuss yet. I don&rsquo;t know where I land on the atheism spectrum but I know I have shifted in the past decade. Is social atheism a thing? And if so, can it be coupled with existential nihilism?</p>

<p>I like overwhelming my brain as of late but I need to tread lighltly as nto to seem #verysmart</p>


<p>BRB, have to Google how to show a hash sign in markdown without turning it int oa header&hellip;</p>

<p>Ok. Continuing:</p>

<p>So I will be exploring philosophy as my new free study subject. I won&rsquo;t be engaging in discussion though. I&rsquo;m gonna try to avoid any foot-in-mouth like what I ended up with during Political-poluza 2016.</p>

<p>And if the rabbit hole ends up caving in on me, I can just move to a new subject to study. I still have Unity development I can learn, or finish working with the 2D roguelike python framework that I used to fork the tank roguelike a while back. Maybe I should just learn Python completely and be done with it. In any case. I have avenue to walk down and hopefully I will stop by a door wit ha light on and some new books to read.</p>

<p>I do have a theory on the subject of free will versus determinism. I think it&rsquo;s a bit of both. I think there maybe be a sort of biological RNG working behind the scenes. So if you subscribe to free will, it would mean that you choose to do a thing. If you subscribe to determinism, you are destined to do a thing. What if there is a weight chance of you being either destined to do a thing or a weighted chance that you can do the thing of your own will? more on this as I understand what the hell it is I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to listen to music when I write sometimes. When I wrote poetry a few generations of poems ago, I would listen to jazz as I felt that is what I needed to tap into my secret beatnik past. I&rsquo;m listening to a guilty-pleasure band now called Black Tongue. They are a novelty band of sorts. Down Tempo is a genre some people place on them. I&rsquo;d like to think they are the spiritual successors to an ill-fated genre of yore called Sludge Core or Sludge Metal. The like consists of unclean, usually nasally vocals coupled with very low tuned guitars with heavy chugging riffs and drums that are at once angry, dramatic and painfully slow. It&rsquo;s like listening to a normal heavier jsut-below-the-surface band but slowed down. Like you are high on some good weed or something. In any case I digress.</p>

<p>The system is corrupt! Raise your hand if you just heard the news. No? Nobody? Ok, I&rsquo;ll segway into the first possible topic I want to write about tonight.</p>

<p><strong>WHY I VOTED FOR THE BOOGY MAN</strong></p>

<p>This election season was a first for a lot of millennials. This election season was a good waking point for a lot of people. This was the first time I am aware that we had 2 anti-establishment candidates running. And both had a good chance of winning. Arguably, one still does. I have been a rabble-rouser for the majority of my life. I like disrupting the normal order of things whenever I can get the chance.  So when we had a rabble-rouser or two running, I started paying attention. This election, there was a candidate running that had the potential to really shake shit up in the Capital. Bernie Sander&rsquo;s now cult following was scary for most of the establishment. Much in the same way Trump is scary to educated people in and around the US.</p>

<p>I liked a lot of what Benie was spouting, not just because I was/am a student and there was a chance that I wouldn&rsquo;t end up paying a fuck ton of money for an education that should be pennies on the dollar should we have any hope for our country to continue as leaders in the sciences and maths, and not because I wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by his tax bracket switheroos. And of course, almost everyone reading this now or even in the4 future would have dodged that bullet. But I liked that he was a crazy, old Jew that came from nothing, had nothing and yet still manage to fight for the common good and equality of the country every chance he got. He has no money, he follows socialism in a pure form, and his stage presence probably helped a bit.</p>

<p>But, and this is a big BUT:</p>

<p>The reason I voted for the boogy man is because he wasn&rsquo;t Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.</p>

<p>And that is why I will be voting for Gary Johnson. I don&rsquo;t even know any of his stances on anything. But he isn&rsquo;t Hillary or Donald.</p>

<p>So we won&rsquo;t get our socialist president. It&rsquo;s ok. Sanders did a disservice for a lot of his anti-establishment followers when he publicly announced he is backing Hillary. It took the whole movement back a few years. The noise is gone now. The tide is receding and those who were angry enough to do anything are now playing Pokemon Go. Sanders is done and now we can only welcome either the Criminal or the Fraud with open arms.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Socialism/Anti-establishment movement should be over. Whether it actually is, I&rsquo;m unsure of just yet. Black Lives Matters is still relatively strong, even after the police shooting in Dallas. And they are very much anti-establishment. I just wish they could organize enough to know who the real bad guy is. We, the Socialist rabble-rousing folks are on their side. I am, for one a major supporter of unadulterated equal rights. I can&rsquo;t call myself any one label since I am personally wanting of equality for all. It&rsquo;s a tough fight in a nation dividing by every new bit of news anymore.</p>

<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t bode well if Trump becomes president. I know the loud ones are few and far between, and I know most of them are uneducated and don&rsquo;t really have any real means of shaking things up. I know this because I had an argument with one one time and he responded to my open acceptance of Socialism by saying &ldquo;If you love Socialism so much, why don&rsquo;t you move to North Korea?&rdquo; I paraphrased as to use proper grammar. But I was floored by this comment. Have you ever lost an argument that you were right on? It&rsquo;s a weird thing to say the least. Granted that is  small sample size, but there are more. Much more.</p>

<p>He has been talking for an entire year and hasn&rsquo;t said a single thing. Well, he has said stuff. He usually just spouts off racial slurs and basically acts like a complete bigot on stage and the anti-intellectualists eat it right up. He speaks to the lowest denominator and those in turn get the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; to live vicariously through him. How did I would this before&hellip; His supporters are ok with living a wee bit above poverty because they are told that if they work hard all their lives, they will rise a little bit on the societal ladder before they die and they use Trump as some sort of  Golden Idol to get them to crawl through the shit each day.</p>

<p>Hillary is bought and paid for shill. AT&amp;T put over $5 million in her pocket, big oil is in her bed and as was shown to us. the fucking FBI won&rsquo;t even do anything to hinder her chance in the white house. A meme came around a few weeks ago comparing Hillary to Edward Snowden. Snowden in an absolute hero for uncovering the illegal activities that the government was engaging in and he is now in exile. Hillary did something on the same level and is probably getting a seat in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Its weird.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s gonan get weirder.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m grumpy today and I really don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe letting this blog go to the wayside hasn&rsquo;t helped me handle my own thoughts as of late. Maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy because that damn Pokemon Go app keeps shitting the bed for me. I just got back from walking all the way to campus and as if the app knew it, it just stopped working. I rebooted my phone and got a exclamation mark next to my phone battery and my screen wouldn&rsquo;t auto-adjust like it should and I&rsquo;ve been grumpy since before that and that just set me off and I went into Tamtrum Derrick Mode.</p>

<p>Maybe that was it. Can I blame it on the game? I love the idea of an ARG actually getting popular so I&rsquo;m very intrigued by it but all the same, it&rsquo;s a Pokemon game. I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m playing a silly Pokemon game. Maybe it&rsquo;s something different.</p>

<p>At this point I would usually segway into a list of things I&rsquo;d like to cover and write some sort of hyper-lengthy wall of text about why everything else is wrong and I&rsquo;m right but instead I think I&rsquo;ll try something new.</p>

<p>A confession of sorts.</p>

<p>I have been trolling the ever-loving shit out of a family-friend&rsquo;s Facebook buddies. I&rsquo;ve been engaging in some ruthless back and forth political banter and it&rsquo;s been a blast. I originally wanted to engage in actual worthwhile discussion but soon realized that they would always resort to childish name calling and decided to have fun with it ever since. The wife hates it. And I don&rsquo;t even know why I keep at it. I just like watching them squirm and fall into the Decartes-esque sort of pseudo-logical circular reasoning. I find it fascinating that I can predict their reactions based on what I say. It&rsquo;s the perfect example of cronyism. Or at least a sample of the cronyism that the country is controlled by.</p>

<p>You couple that with my recent binge-listening to Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Common Sense and I&rsquo;m starting to see how the whole political system works. The short explanation is “It doesn&rsquo;t.” And yeah, teenage angsty rebel Derrick knew that but for some reason at 30 or so I wanted to REALLY know that.</p>

<p>The fun factor is that in the process, I&rsquo;ve learned who I am politically. And I&rsquo;ve alienated almost my entire family because of it. That post will be for another day but for now let&rsquo;s focus on what is next.</p>

<p>It was this morning during the “24 Hour Facebook Fallout Rule” when said family-friend and cronies where back-and-forthing about the Dallas police shooting and how the police finally used a drone to subdue him. I&rsquo;ve so far succeeded in not giving my 2 cents. But it&rsquo;s easier this time. And this is why.</p>

<p>I am a futurist. I absolutely adore the possibilities of what the future will have, and will look like. I hunger for that sort of Utopian version where we have reached post-scarcity and monetary gratification is no longer needed. We are a long way off. Automation is going to get there and it will pave the way but we need to be careful about it. Automation won&rsquo;t exist as long as capitalism does. Well, it can&rsquo;t. If it doesn&rsquo;t then we see 1% get hyper-rich and 99% get hyper-poor. Imagine 280 Donald Trumps running the House and Senate. It would be like that only more narcissistic.</p>

<p>Robotics is going to disrupt the country and the world. We can joke all we want about McDonald&rsquo;s replacing the $15-per-hourers with kiosks but if we aren&rsquo;t going to prepare for the fallout that is unemployment that will surely follow we are digging an economic grave. Almost every job out there is as easily replaceable as the McDonald&rsquo;s cashier. If you don&rsquo;t realize that then you are an idiot.</p>

<p>Wat does this have to do with drones killing people? Aside from the fact that they have been doing that in the middle east for a few years now, this means that everything involving law enforcement changes. Those out there waving their gun rights in everyone&rsquo;s faces claiming that they should be able to shoot whomever they want if they trespass or look at them sideways just got a reality check. The 2nd amendment just got a little more fun. You have the right to bear arms but your arms will be substantially less affective against a remotely controlled machine.</p>

<p>If Asimov needed a chapter zero to his laws of robotics, this is it. Everything changes now. You can say it was unfair. You can say the police should have subdued him with bodily force and stuffed him in a jail cell until it was time for lethal injection. You can say all you want, but you have to understand that law enforcement will never be the same. This is a beginning and complaining about your guns and my rights and showing pictures of your guns leaning up against the wall not killing anybody is not what we need to be doing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this will spur new laws but considering how Congress is twiddling their thumbs about encryption, this is gonna take a while. I think the best way to speed things up is if some black hat hacker came along and hijacked one of those drones. Kill two(or three) birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Maybe down the road, I&rsquo;ll cover the whole alienating bit and encryption as if that hasn&rsquo;t been picked apart clean already.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What happens now? I just finished wrapping up my last CIDM class and everything else is in order. I have one more class to take over the summer but I do get to walk on Saturday. So there is that. I&rsquo;m also finishing my entire college career with A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s because I tried.</p>

<p>So what now? I have a job lined up with the USDA but I also got a phone call from a staffing agency that needed a web developer position filled. After some sleuthing, it turns out that it was not a scam but there was just some oppsies with emails. That position offers twice what USDA is offering in the way of pay. Both jobs are temporary, but the web dev one is temp-to-hire. If they offer it to me, I kind of gotta take it but then I&rsquo;d be letting down the USDA folks who sent me an unofficial offer email the other day.</p>

<p>Then there was the web dev job for CSI that fell through but they still have a position opened that Babb mentioned today so I sent him an email that said toss my name in and let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll fill you in once I know what the hell is going on. I&rsquo;m gonna cut this short since I wanted to get started on re-learning PHP. I was gonna wait until next week but if not now, then never. Right?</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I decided to move this blog to my local computer instead of hosting the dev version on cloud 9. A version will stll be there but it will probably not get updated unless I have a reason to do otherwise. Since I&rsquo;m just pushing and not actually doing any sort of QC, this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue and I can set up another repo on my laptop.</p>

<p>I might consider adding an new method in my rakefile for pulling all the things based on my &ldquo;rake push&rdquo; one.</p>

<p>Other then that, I had wanted to write a blog post about how I feel that the MMO is dying after trying to play Ryzom after it got it&rsquo;s debut on Steam after being around for 12 years. I played it, felt very &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it and will probably play Cities: Skylines for the rest of the night. It&rsquo;s holding my attention more anyway. At least, when I&rsquo;m not chasing down bugs and glitches from mods.</p>

<p>In any case, this is  gonna be shorter anyway since it&rsquo;s more intended to be a teser post to see if I have everything plugged in properly.</p>

<p>Peace,

    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/05/04/its-been-a-long-time</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello darkness, my old friend. Or rather oi to those who are still there and able to read something I write without being overly offended by crass observations of the politcal machine.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I wrote something for this little hacker-sheet blog but I have been having one hell for a semester as I work to tie up lose ends for a degree that will either be worth every penny or not.</p>

<p>I have fucked up in more ways then I care to admit in my online class and then that came through in a on-campus class, ironically taught by the same professor. I have forgotten to turn in 2 assignments, both of which were done a week before they were due, and I forgot to do a weekly busy-work assignment which counts as my drop assignment. Of course this happened before my professor made a decision to count all extra work that would otherwise be dropped towards our final grade in case we needed an extra push from a B to an A. Or in my case, from a D to a C.</p>

<p>So the past is behind us, right?</p>

<p>I chose 2 electives this semester to add a bit of zen to the otherwise chaotic months I knew were ahead. 1) Creative Writing: Poetry and 2) MCOM: Photography. Both have been an absolute blast. Halfway through my photography class, that professor started to give us a bit of creative wiggle room, which I being the pretentious/eccentric/asshole-ish/etc person that I have become, used to explore an avenue that I knew wasn&rsquo;t very known. Glitch Art is a very experimental and exploratory art style that involved literally breaking images and videos in such a way that they have digital artifacting and often, unexpected results. It&rsquo;s a style that looks awesome, creepy, surreal, and yet familiar. All at the same time. It&rsquo;s almost an homage to the last 30+ years of technological advancement on a personal level and that is what I find so intriguing about it. That NES game is fucked up and Mario is a blocking glitchy caricature of his former self? Fuck it, it&rsquo;s art now! I mean it has more depth then that but I like to imagine that happened in a cafe somewhere in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In any case I fell into a style that I can only describe as pseudo-bending, where you take an image and run it through a glitching app on your phone. I think the app uses similar algorithms that standard pixel sorting software, or the like uses but has a more instant result. I borrowed from the styles that a Flickr photographer named Kai Rennert uses and added some filters and tweeted the contrast/saturation/etc to aim for this sort of old-timy feel of more modern imagery. It&rsquo;s an interesting approach to say the least but there is a fine line between art and Instagram filter. I&rsquo;m learning still.</p>

<p>Next up, my poetry class. I had a hard time coming up with a first poem for the class and ended up writing about my shitty ex girlfriend. My lovely wife got mad and we fought. So in an attempt at saving face, I said, &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll write every one after about you!&rdquo; And she said &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>It was a blast too.</p>

<p>Gutten-Trollen.</p>

<p>Every new style were learned became a challenge to tell a new chapter of our lives together and it worked out very well. Then I had to write a free verse at the end of the semester. I was like &ldquo;I got this&rdquo; since, well, I write free verse. But I ended up writing 2 separate ones, in very different styles, on top of starting the first one 3 different times, jotting down lines here and there in between bouts of writer&rsquo;s block, etc. I ended up writing a 3.5 page poem much in the same vein as Ginsberg. And just about died. I realized that should I use that one, it would create a lot of bad noise, so I opted for the shorter second one, written in the style that I traditionally use. It was cute and I went with that one. I let a classmate named Jason read my longform and he cried, hit me with said poem several times, said he hated me a dozen or so times, and then said I had to read that one instead. I had the professor print copies for me last minute and read it. I didn&rsquo;t get a standing ovation but I didn&rsquo;t get much of a response aside from reading it in the rambling manner that I did, take out commas when it won&rsquo;t break things, and that it was, in fact, Ginsberg-esque. I have it on another blog so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>

<p>In the end, my plan to write everything about my wife came through and now I&rsquo;m planning on turning it into a chapbook for our anniversary. I&rsquo;m gonna see about putting it into eFormat on Kindle too. Maybe sell it for $3 a pop.</p>

<p>Programming has been an absolute disaster. We have a flat tire in our group, which is too be expected but fuck that guy. He rubs Keith and I the wrong way. hasn&rsquo;t done any checkins on TFS, acts like RAM is the key to all computer issues, acts like he know the difference from a motherboard and a skateboard, and just overall sucks to be around. He&rsquo;s black so if you say anything at all that can be taken in anyway possible as racist, he acts like you just killed and fucked his mom. It&rsquo;s the worst. Say a bit of code is ghetto, and you are making fun of his upbringing, say my name is spelled in the way that I&rsquo;ve observed is commonly spelled by black folk and I just basically told him I wish his people were still slaves. It&rsquo;s the absolute worst and I don&rsquo;t think I like it all too much. One day I jokingly said, after fucking with broken ass code for about 3 hours straight &ldquo;this is why I don&rsquo;t believe in God.&rdquo; (which isn&rsquo;t why I don&rsquo;t btw&hellip;) And he responded with the fact that I can&rsquo;t be in the same room as him, otherwise he will just have to murder me (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here). Like, what? It&rsquo;s clearing in print in the first amendment that you can believe in whatever you want, so there is a chance that you will probably, at one point or another, associate with a non-believer. AND THAT IS OK! Seriously, life will continue. The world will be just fine, fanatics will still kill people, and the US gov will still be Capitalist. Shit will be fine, my friend.</p>

<p>On top of that, I just need to survive finals week, pick up these 3 last credit hours and start my job at the USDA on the 31st of May. It&rsquo;s a contract position but I get to hack around with Raspberry Pis and Linux for 12.50/hour. I would do that in the summer for free so I guess I win?</p>

<p>Over this semester, I&rsquo;ve lost my mind, drank 3423453 bottles of whiskey, rum, beer, water. Ate ramen and ribeye, ported a roguelike written in Python over to Linux, added conditional Pebble Time Round support to a watchapp written in C, got 2 websites sort of up, and made a few friends and enemies. I removed 30+ people on FB because I don&rsquo;t like them. I found out my DM unfollowed me and instead of becoming angry about it, I had a realization that I am also an asshole. I&rsquo;m unlikeable. It made me sad and now I&rsquo;m going through a bit of depression over it. It sucks but it might finally be my moment that i can finally get off FB. It&rsquo;s just toxic and Idk if I need to help with that. I&rsquo;m famously good at trolling people on there but it&rsquo;s no longer fun. I am at a point where now I post things as satire about myself. Like, I am making fun of me for fun. I figure, I can do this and only offend me,(It&rsquo;s almost impossible to offend me)</p>

<p>Idk, I need to move on. Things are changing and I don&rsquo;t want to become a product for my children on FB. I don&rsquo;t want the gov to have access to FB&rsquo;s face recognition software so they can keep tabs on my kids. It&rsquo;s not fair to them and you never know who Uncle Touch is. I guess that is a good way to finish this. Social Media has become a means for the gov to keep tabs on everyone. the NSA is still watching. Coarse location is a way of tracking you via your phone without GPS. It is used. All the time. By FB, Sprint, TWC, NSA, and the list goes on. Cortona wants to know your location on your desktop computer and that is fucking scary. We need a revolution. We need a new internet. We need P2P,. Encryption, FOSS, freedom, and basic rights. This can&rsquo;t continue. We need better education, not just in the classrooms but on the web. you shouldn&rsquo;t be a product for Big Cable, Big Oil, Big Advert. We need our lives back and we aren&rsquo;t going to do that by putting our children on shelves on FB without their fucking consent. Stop it.</p>

    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/02/22/socks-and-socialism</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sometimes think to hard on a subject so when I get around to wanting to write it, I&rsquo;ve at least mentally moved on. I&rsquo;ve never liked this about myself, because at least from a philosophical standpoint, my ideas help define me. They help me progress as a human and going back and looking at how I was at a given time allows me to understand myself better.</p>

<p>For example, barely over a decade ago, I used to be a very loud and proud atheist. I was very vocal about how awesome it was to not believe in a god. I was very up front about how believing in one made you stupid. I look back on that and realize how far I have come. I&rsquo;m always trying to be a better person, regardless of faith, education, or social status. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve started on a journey of trying to give back. It&rsquo;s hard but it can change you forever, when you get to that point where you can help and do it humbly. I never want a “thank you” from what I do but it&rsquo;s always nice to hear.</p>

<p>For almost a year now, I&rsquo;ve been helping in the kitchen at the in-law&rsquo;s church&rsquo;s Prayer Breakfast. We offer a warm breakfast for people who are homeless or in poverty. And really, anyone can come who wants a free meal. It&rsquo;s abundantly clear that we don&rsquo;t care where you come form.</p>

<p>On a side note, I remember a while back hearing a gentleman there telling someone that they don&rsquo;t even believe in God, they just show up for he free food. Guess what guy? That&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t believe either. I don&rsquo;t do this because God wants me to. I do this because I want to.</p>

<p>I was going to write about the success of our sock drive last week but got busy. School, wife, DnD, BuffTeks, and writing a video game, watchapp, whatever, tends to get in the way sometime. So on to the sock drive.</p>

<p>I gave up counting how many we ended up with after 1,077 pairs. We personally bought 4 packs of 10 pair. If we stick to handing out 2 pair per person, that ends up being enough for 20 people, and we gathered over 1 thousand. That&rsquo;s enough for 500 people. Only a bit more then 200 people showed up and pizza/bingo and we handed out a bit less per head. We still have a lot of socks left and Mark and I were worried about not getting enough. That blows my mind. Central always calls themselves a body, but they act more like a machine. They are brutally efficient at helping out the community. I wish more people were like that.</p>

<p>My next plan is hopefully going to be bigger, but it&rsquo;s still early in it&rsquo;s infancy while we try to figure out how to hand out the rest of these socks. I want to open a public garden for anyone who wants to harvest vegetables for free. When you look at the price of vegetables in the grocery store versus the price of seeds, it just makes sense that fruit and vegetables should move into a socialistic product. I don&rsquo;t have the math done right now but I can promise that the cost of planting seeds and watering plants is virtually free in the scheme of feeding the hungry. The only issues is finding land and finding people who will donate their time. America is Capitalistic by nature so Social Economics will be extremely hard to pull off even at this scale. I mean I can see people doing it for a short term but I want this to be sustainable as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet future blogs on this platform will start becoming more Socialistic in nature. I feel that is where my life is heading. I want to explore Socialism and this garden might be a good chance. The socks were.</p>

<p>That leads me to a idea that came from a discussion with my wife. She feels that people should give of their own accord, and I feel that they won&rsquo;t. The only people that generally give are religions people. And the church is getting smaller. Non-beleivers don&rsquo;t help by nature&rsquo;s design. A lot of believers only help reluctantly. The country isn&rsquo;t set up for social economics yet, but it could work. It does work. I almost think it might even happen naturally. Automation is going to change our entire existence. It&rsquo;s going to displace millions of workers decades at a time. A curious number suggests that in just 6 decades, we will see a global unemployment of 50%. conservatives say we will see new jobs, but I venture a guess that we will lose jobs a hell of a lot faster then we will gain. New jobs won&rsquo;t matter. If we lose these jobs to automation, and if longevity of life continues to increase, we are going to have to come up with some sort of alternative to the workforce. We need an alternative means to survival. Free food should be an option for survival.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost time for America to rethink what freedom is. It isn&rsquo;t living under the umbrella of materialism as a luxury. I deserve freedom and so do you. Hard work for money is a fleeting idea. It&rsquo;s time to move to a new economic existence where everyone is equal, regardless of their parents. It&rsquo;s time to remove social status. It&rsquo;s time to fix where our money goes.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got done watching a parody of Mr. Robot, where our favorite antagonist “hacks” his friend via SMS to ask for their Netflix credentials. Then as he is binge watching Making a Murder, he Hacked into Facebook to see what everyone is doing. The parody was really well done and my favorite part was when he hacked into the ma n' pa pizza site and found a co-u-pon bug in the system where he exploited it to receive discounted food.</p>

<p>Watch it. Youtube “Mr. Brobot.” It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>My friend has started a Jekyll blog much like how this blog runs. I&rsquo;m using Octopress for mine but it just sits on top of Jekyll so I&rsquo;m being pampered and he isn&rsquo;t. I donno how to go about doing a new post with just Jekyll but with Octopress it&rsquo;s a simple</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yesterday I learned about materialism. I learned that in the US, you are allowed selective materialism. It&rsquo;s ok to look down upon people who have cars and watches you can&rsquo;t afford but phones don&rsquo;t count. A phone is not a materialistic thing because anti-materialists have smart phones. They also justify their phone by announcing how cheap or free it actually was. All-the-while being glued to it as if it&rsquo;s their portal to the world. They could live without it but it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything wrong with smart phones or materialism actually. I&rsquo;m in fact, very fond of technology and disposable incomes. It&rsquo;s one of the perk of living in the first world. When disposal income became a real thing in the 1910&rsquo;s and 20&rsquo;s we really went forward. We could afford cars and dishwashers AND pay for the occasional movie or enjoy any sort of luxury without much thought. How many times do we go out to eat? How often do we buy things on Amazon that we can do without?</p>

<p>So back to the materialism post. The post was implying that Rolexes and Mercedes and StarBucks don&rsquo;t make the person. And at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s just a watch, a car, and a Frappe Mocha Chai Latte with soy milk. My comment was intended to be a sarcastic joke that I suppose blew up. I made the joke that the post was “* sent from my iPhone.”</p>

<p>So what did I mean by that you might ask? Apparenty I meant that my family members all run out and buy new iPhones whenever the latest model comes out. I apparently meant that they just throw money at Apple like the company is some sort of fruit-oriented techno-prostotution congratulate. Because let&rsquo;s face it. They are. We even go as far as snorting cocaine off of our iPhone screens like little glass hooker butt cheeks.</p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. I meant that you live in, and enjoy a materialistic world, regardless of any shitpost you share on Facebook. I meant that regardless of if you are a penny pincher, or stingy or frugal or [insert synonym here] that you are, at the very least, a little bit materialistic. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like an extremist: “Why not just walk everywhere if a car is such a burden on your pride?”, “Use the sun to tell the time of day.”, “Instead of Starbucks, just eat a pint of cheap non-cream-based ice cream every morning.” Nah, I wasn&rsquo;t implying that either.</p>

<p>My point was that It&rsquo;s a little bit hypocritical and shows envy to post something suggesting that things you actually don&rsquo;t own are what make someone materialistic while supporting that things you do own do not. You do not need a $700-$900 smart phone, but they sure are nice, huh? You could have opted for the cheapy budget phone but it wasn&rsquo;t as nice of specs. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still a phone. The post in question said the same thing about a car. A Mercedes is a nice luxury car, but in the end, you just need a car to get from one place to another. Couple this idea with the fact that Apple is marketed in the US as a luxury device. It&rsquo;s a Mercedes phone. It&rsquo;s a Starbucks phone. It&rsquo;s a Rolex phone. The same can be said for anyone who upgrades to the next $700-$900 flagship from Samsung each year. Why drive a Ford Galaxy when you could drive a Samsung Galaxy?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get that no one on Facebook understands my sarcasm. That&rsquo;s fine. I think a lot of what they post is stupid, wrong, weird, pedo-suggestive, whatever and sometimes it bugs me too. Facebook is intentionally designed to divide family and friends. It&rsquo;s the “meth that ruins the family” of the internet. Only instead of rotted teeth and acne, it&rsquo;s political extremism, breast feeding drama, agenda weirdness, and shitty sports memes.</p>

<p>So with that, if you want to post your shitposts about how bad materialism is from your expensive-ass iPhone 6 Plus or whatever, that&rsquo;s fine. Go for it. Enjoy your luxury device from your cheap ass car and your probably Starbucks, and drive to your salon to get a pedicure, and watch your streaming television and enjoy your T-Bone steak and Beats by Dre. Just never buy a Mercedes. Because materialism is bad.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post isn&rsquo;t intended to be directed towards the family involved in the mentioned post. It&rsquo;s intended to bring a point about how we post things and only believe half-assed about the ideals behind it. That&rsquo;s an ingrained American trait. It happens all the time and isn&rsquo;t limited to the price point on cars, coffee, and watches. We are a lazy nation. That&rsquo;s fine. We are a wasteful and self-absorbed nation. That&rsquo;s probably not fine but c'est la vie. It&rsquo;s just the nature of things. We are trying to move away from Imperialism while globalization is growing and we are leaning towards a closed-wall fascism so it should only be right that we ignore the bad traits about us and focus on the good. We should only take things from the Bible that align with our personal interests. The same goes for politics. As we become more fascist in nature, we naturally shouldn&rsquo;t allow any outside influence on us. We should welcome the hyper-inflation that comes with bringing our factories back from overseas. After all, in the end, it should only be about us as long as we can make excuses for others and what others have. Right?</p>

    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/10/when-we-walk</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to write this for my other blog as I think the idea of it has switched gears, and maybe I will do that tomorrow but for now. Let&rsquo;s toss some ideas around. Tomorrow I am meeting with Mark Love to discuss the sock drive. He wants to know what brought me to want to do this and honestly, even though the concept behind it is simple, me coming this far is a bit more complex. I can just tell hims that I saw a statistic on a social sharing site that mentioned how of all the clothing items donated across the country, socks are least donated and yet, in most demand.</p>

<p>But that really isn&rsquo;t the whole story. Part is that I wanted to get a bunch of people together to do this, and asking non-Christians is out of the questions since they are more selfish with their financial wealth. That is also going along the idea that economically speaking, I think money is innately evil though, but that is a story for another day. Right, now we DO need money to function, but we shouldn&rsquo;t and part of our future relies on alternate means of wealth.</p>

<p>Regardless, money isn&rsquo;t the issue that drove me to this, and yes, the statistic was part of it but I think there was more to this idea. I was a part of the Blanket Amarillo thing, but won&rsquo;t be associating with the group that put that together. I was talking to Marli this morning and realized that you cannot help through advocay without actually helping by getting your hands dirty. Yelling at a bunch of guys intuits about blankets for the homeless all while shunning the most helpful group of people by constantly stating that you want to give the blankets without the church being involved is a bit ridiculous.</p>

<p>I have my suspicions that a few involved are only in it to advocate legalization of marijuana in Texas, and I am all for that but don&rsquo;t use the less fortunate as your stage to do so. That is a dick move if I have ever seen one.</p>

<p>In talking to Professor Hayward last semester, I have understood that the advocacy thing is a natural college student thing. Get out there and yell into your bullhorns and get heard. I get that. But again, unless you get your hands dirty and live with them, you have no idea of the conditions.</p>

<p>In the end, Blanket Amarillo is nothing more than a means of rebellion against authority and it doesn&rsquo;t help at all. We gave a few people some blankets and pillows and then went home. The law is the same and police can take the blankets still. Nothing changes via political involvement.</p>

<p>You change things by getting a hold of a group of people who want to change things. I know a group just like that. The church, regardless of what condition it is in, in the 21st century will always help. And they will do it in an organized manner, without the cameras and spotlights. Without a stage, and surely without some angsty college hubris.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I am going to tell Mark, as far as my story goes. I don&rsquo;t think I really even have one. I&rsquo;m an Atheist that wants to help the less fortunate and making breakfast (almost) every Sunday for them isn&rsquo;t just isn&rsquo;t cutting it anymore. He says that when people come to him with this sort of thing, the idea comes from the heart, always. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure it did, but weirdly enough, does it have to be spiritual?</p>

<p>Do I sit down at Leal&rsquo;s and start the conversation, “Why don&rsquo;t Atheists help out more?”  “Why are Atheists so fucking selfish that they can&rsquo;t donate a single ounce of effort to help here and there?” “Why is money so important to them?” I don&rsquo;t know if that is the best approach, but I&rsquo;m sure my faith, or lack there of, will come up. I think it&rsquo;s important that he know I am not a Christian, but I still want to help and be a part of the church.</p>

<p>Activism and advocacy is great and all, but there is more powerful means then sitting on the steps of a government building with a handful of blankets. You aren&rsquo;t going to change the world with some box guitars and pot fliers. I was going to get the Blanket Amarillo group involved in the sock drive as well, to finally cross that line drawn between Christians and Atheists, but like most Atheists, they aren&rsquo;t ready yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not lambasting them. If they want to continue to help in their own way, that is great. It&rsquo;s good to have foot soldiers on the war against poverty, but it won&rsquo;t help to not acknowledge that the church has done a lot of great things for the community. The church in a whole has done more then any of us can really grasp. But I think we, as Atheists, like to continue to cling on to the idea that the church is only trying to fill pews and look better in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>I know. I used to be that way too. But once you can let go of your Atheist pride, the veil becomes easier to remove. Then you realize that if you truly want to help, the church is a very important means of doing so. Christians simply want to help. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>“When We Walk” will be the name of my blog on my WordPress site as well, but it will focus on some other aspects of giving back and why we don&rsquo;t. Like this one, I have no idea how that one will go.</p>

    <updated>2016-01-08T09:45:13-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/08/new-year</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it&rsquo;s now 2016. That means a lot of stuff. Mainly, we survived the year, 2015. The year of the crybabies, hypersensetives, annoying agenda freaks, and a whole slew of wtfs. I try to keep in my mind that the world is less violent per statistics. We just have better coverage of things going on around hte globe. News travels faster as technology speeds up. News version of Moore&rsquo;s law?</p>

<p>Anywho, this year is gonna be better. I can feel it. I think. I&rsquo;m gonna stay way from FB-made drama and focus more on other outlets of social media. It&rsquo;s better that way. People are assholes and I don&rsquo;t need to be affected by them.</p>

<p>So new year, huh? I&rsquo;m trying new me this year. I don&rsquo;t have a set-in=stone resolution as much as a goal to end the year better then I started it. I&rsquo;ve started already. I installed my bidet yesterday and it&rsquo;s so nice. If you have never sprayed water at your butthole after taking a shit, I highly suggest you give it a whirl. It&rsquo;s jsut fantastic. I also got my ergo keyboard yesterday. It&rsquo;s hard to get used to but I hope it works out for me. My only real issue is that it doesn&rsquo;t fit on my keyboard tray properly. Other than that, after typing a while on it it feels weird going to my mouse. The hotkeys are a nice touch though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently at a wall on my watch app, but more on that later on in another post.</p>

<p>Other new me stuff? I am finishing my school stuff this year. I opted for photography instead of data mining since it doesn&rsquo;t have a book. DM was online but I don;t think I will end up employed before the semester is over so that is fine. I just need to get out and shoot every now and then.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;m only taking one CIS class this semester and it&rsquo;s the sucky one. Babb is becoming the source of my anxiety and high blood pressure and I&rsquo;m ready to be done with these classes.</p>

<p>One last thing. New me also included growing a beard. Or rather, On Jan 1 I decided I didn&rsquo;t feel like shaving. So far it almost looks like a beard. We&rsquo;ll see how long it goes.</p>

<p>Anywho. I got other things to do and I need to teach myself how to type again since this keyboard has a learning curve.</p>

<p>At that, deuces!</p>

    <link href="http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2015/12/31/last-day-on-earth/"/>
    
    <updated>2015-12-31T11:40:29-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2015/12/31/last-day-on-earth</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here we go. Today is the last day of 2015 and my last day at FP. Aside from not doing much work-type work over the last couple of months I have actually kept myself busy learning new things and honing some skills. One example of what I have learned is in this very blog. It&rsquo;s OctoPress, built off of Jekyll, and using Ruby on Rails. I host this site through Github and it&rsquo;s all pretty swanky. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll post what the site looks like from the backend to put it in to perspective.</p>

<p>Other things I have learned this year and since being at FP are, some Rails, a bit more PHP, a lot of WordPress magic and some JavaScript stuff. Failed at learning Objective C and Python. But I am actually using Python for a project at the moment. I posted about it yesterday. More on that in a bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve severed ties with some people this year. I&rsquo;ve been working on being less toxic as a human being and that involved cutting out the toxic in other people, and thus, cutting out those people. Aaron could be a great person if he would just accept that other people are different and that is fine. The world is working in favor of equality, including the rights of homosexuals and he can&rsquo;t see that behind a veil of bigotry for bigotry&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ve learned a while ago that if people think different from you. That&rsquo;s fine. They don&rsquo;t decide your fate. You do. I&rsquo;ve also learned that there is a huge difference between being an Atheist and being an Anti-Christian. When you go out of your way to antagonize believers and turn it on themselves when they speak up, you are a horrible person. No amount of &ldquo;look at how bad they are&rdquo; will make you look any better. I do want to write full piece on this but donno which blog it is better suited for. It&rsquo;s a very shitshow topic. It&rsquo;ll probably end up there after my Future of Economy piece.</p>

<p>The others I have cut out, I&rsquo;m not very worried about either. It was an occasional Facebook like, share, comment, whatever. And that means absolutely nothing to me. I was never even friends with Jessica to begin with. She is a very toxic person and I don&rsquo;t need that. At all.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have been more helpful in regards to the less fortunate and plan on getting more involved. We are doing a sock drive in February and I want to try to get the non-faith activists involved if I get the chance via Blanket Amarillo. I donno where to go from there but my end goal is probably awareness and a sense of unity, regardless of what you believe in. You shouldn&rsquo;t use your faith as an excuse to help the needy, and neither should you use your lack of faith. I don&rsquo;t like what that message can send. All it will do is create a disconnect in our society in a sea of disconnect.</p>

<p>So I really, like REALLY want noodles tonight. And if I have any say in that I&rsquo;m getting some damn red curry and rice sticks and a boiled egg. After that is NYE planning. The Fox clan is doing a thing but idk if I wanna go. I always feel alienated and I definitely feel like &ldquo;that guy who knows computers.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy anymore. It&rsquo;s a freaking hobby. I don&rsquo;t call the wife, &ldquo;that chick who knows yarn&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t call my dad &ldquo;that guy who knows cars.&rdquo; Computers is hobby, and as such, I am better at them computers, but I no longer care to wear it as a badge. I&rsquo;m still working on my reaction when someone doesn&rsquo;t understand a simple task though. That&rsquo;s a toughie.</p>

<p>I think tomorrow I&rsquo;ll post a New Year&rsquo;s Resolution blog so that will have to wait.</p>

<p>On to the goods!</p>

<p>I have a pretty functional prototype of my watch app. I&rsquo;m borrowing heavily from the Commander for Pebble but plan on rewriting everything from the ground up to work for what I need. For now, it&rsquo;s a scrollable interface but I want to change it to use Up, Down and Settings button clicks and longpresses instead. The first version as of last night about 9:45 and 2 glasses of whiskey does actually work though. And a surprise was that voice commands work extremely well. I don&rsquo;t know if I want voice commands for an app intended for music but I might keep it. It&rsquo;ll add that secret agent aspect that a lot of smartwatch enthusiasts like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hosting the HTML bits on this blog actually. I made a new route for it at <a href="http://androidhell.github.io/settings/.">http://androidhell.github.io/settings/.</a> You can go there but without an Android and a Pebble&hellip; and a Linux machine&hellip; and Pithos, it won&rsquo;t do much. That&rsquo;s another fear of mine. This is so niche that I don&rsquo;t know if anyone will care. I want to add OS X and Windows support later and aside from learning how to add python and Pithos to either of those OS&rsquo;s, it should be fairly straightforward. I would just need to test it. A major thing is that it uses media controls so it isn&rsquo;t necessarily a Pithos app. I could rebrand it for other music applications but might need to compile a tested list so people don&rsquo;t freak out. An example is that if you have the Spotify client, it should work fine but from my experience, Pithos tends to hijack controls over other players. Simple solution would be to just run a single app.</p>

<p>More on this as it develops.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have 5 more hours left as Senior Web Surfer at FP. I&rsquo;ve cleaned out my computer and sent some code stuff  to my Drive account to sift through later. I removed programs with my accounts tied to them except Chrome. I&rsquo;ll uninstall it right before I leave. I know they won&rsquo;t do anything but I&rsquo;d rather not have a trail to all my online activities since Google uses syncing across computers.</p>

<p>This year is almost over. Time to start working on what to do about next year. 2016 will probably be a shitshow but I may be surprised.</p>

<p><strong>Cliffs:</strong></p>

<p>Everything is a mess. I need to hire a maid. I want to have a working version up by the weekend. We will see how that goes. V2 will have the button configs but v1 will have scrollable commands.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the title is a bit hyperbolic but it still sounds cool. I took yesterday off because I was sick (cough, cough) and stayed in my pjs, playing video games and watching movies with the wifey. It was nice but laundry still isn&rsquo;t done yet. Bleh.</p>

<p>Last week at Financial Payments and no word yet on IT job opportunity. Still hoping but not holding my breath. School is going to be upon us again soon anyway. I need to finalize my classes and get my books ordered. I&rsquo;m worried about finances this last semester. If I don&rsquo;t have a job lined up by May, I&rsquo;m afraid of what might happen next. Damn robots taking mah jobs!</p>

<p>Robots? I meant Mexicans&hellip; yeah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently tinkering with some Linux automation with my Pebble at home but can&rsquo;t get my watch to connect to the server. Waiting on a reply from the dev of the program. It&rsquo;s definitely the watch app since my server boots. I get /GET 200 fine.</p>

<p>I think after this week, I might stream some games next week. Maybe go through some more obscure titles and support that Linux-y thingy. Other than that I need to et back to my other blog. I want to finish the piece on refugees and then start on a bit about how old politics is destroying the technology age.</p>

<p>The refugee piece might only be 1 more post&hellip;</p>

<p>I don’t want to dwell any more on it.</p>

<p>Anywho, Ralkkai, out.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>o the Fox clan did Christmas early this year due to family being in and out of town at various times. We broke tradition of mountains of food and ordered Jason&rsquo;s Deli instead. I got a Reuben and asked for a lighter portion so they only gave me 3 lbs of corned beef. That was nice of them.</p>

<p>Toys? I got some new shinies. First I got a Steam Controller. I wanted it not for a daily driver as much as to just test and mess with. I wanted to see what Valve had to offer as far as hardware. Turns out, aside from a steep learning curve, they have a lot of innovations or gimmicks to offer. I say both because if you like it, it&rsquo;s an innovation and if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a gimmick. (SEE: Samsung Galaxy series.) So first thing would be the touchpads. It did away with a D-pad and a right joystick for some rather fancy technology. Thing having two concaved laptop mousepads. But take it a step further and go with Apple&rsquo;s multi-touch pressure sensitive one. They are fully programmable, have haptic feedback, based on thumb acceleration, and can act as a touch or a click. It&rsquo;s hard to explain beyond that.</p>

<p>The triggers are duel-programmable, similar to the XBox ones where a half pull registers differently from a full pull. The bottom buttons are absolutely fantastic. I can see them adding a bit of immersion for FPS games. Left for reloading and right for scope. You don&rsquo;t have to fumble with clunky controls like on PS or XBox. The face buttons are a reach, like some reviews said. Once you get used to it though, I don&rsquo;t think it will be bad. Think of the XBox left stick reach. They are positioned about there.</p>

<p>The coup de grâce though&hellip; The gyroscopic motion controls. Hungh! I messed with Porta 2 a bit this morning and the Steam-default config is set up in such a way that you aim with the right pad but as your thumb is on it, you also aim with motion controls. Why Nintendo didn&rsquo;t do this with the Wii, I will never know. It will take some getting used to but it&rsquo;s pretty freaking cool.</p>

<p>Other things I got: Cookie butter (because I&rsquo;m a fat kid at heart), a 5.1 surround sounds speaker set (I want to connect them to my computer but if I can&rsquo;t get it to work with Linux, then TV it is.), several watchbands for various occasions along with some quick release pins with are a godsend, and some other stuff like a Tux t-shirt, some gift cards and a power bank for my devices. 13,000mAh baby! My phone will be charged for a full day now!</p>

<p>The family is doing family stuff today and I am at work, waiting out the next week and a half. Still nothing to do. I think I&rsquo;ll continue watching the web dev videos and start working through the PHP/MySQL/JavaScript book I got for Christmas as well.</p>

<p>Anyway, time to do something else besides typing this.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I should be doing other things but instead I&rsquo;ve been working on a new theme for my aging LG G2. I wanted to do a single page layout and then after using KWGT, I ended up messing a bit with KWLP and of course. that is where the rabbit hole started.</p>

<p>I am still stuck on the Flattington theme since I&rsquo;m still stuck on a Beta of PA so if I use any other theme the navbar painting glitches and stays maroon. Instead of feeling stuck with it, I improvised. I built a new theme around the maroon and green and it looks pretty good, imho.</p>

<p>Anyway, I started playing with Kustom and ended up working on a Material Design-inspired animation that has 2 shapes come from top and bottom and a fab button fills out. The animations are sleek abut I&rsquo;m using Apex and can&rsquo;t figure out how to get the transition of the home screen to work with it. I&rsquo;ll continue working on it in my free time and eventually abandon it. I don&rsquo;t even know what to do next with it.</p>

<p>Also, totally off topic but I bought Saint&rsquo;s Row IV last night since it finally got ported. I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with it and it is very much scratching my car sandbox itch. The game is fun and I&rsquo;m upset that I took so long to check it out. One more port to Linux though. This year was looking bleak for Linux gaming with the depressing release of Steam Machines but this last month has been looking better.</p>

<p>Also, get to do X-Mas tonight which is cool. I get to play with my toys early!</p>
