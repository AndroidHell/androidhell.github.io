      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m grumpy today and I really don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe letting this blog go to the wayside hasn&rsquo;t helped me handle my own thoughts as of late. Maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy because that damn Pokemon Go app keeps shitting the bed for me. I just got back from walking all the way to campus and as if the app knew it, it just stopped working. I rebooted my phone and got a exclamation mark next to my phone battery and my screen wouldn&rsquo;t auto-adjust like it should and I&rsquo;ve been grumpy since before that and that just set me off and I went into Tamtrum Derrick Mode.</p>

<p>Maybe that was it. Can I blame it on the game? I love the idea of an ARG actually getting popular so I&rsquo;m very intrigued by it but all the same, it&rsquo;s a Pokemon game. I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m playing a silly Pokemon game. Maybe it&rsquo;s something different.</p>

<p>At this point I would usually segway into a list of things I&rsquo;d like to cover and write some sort of hyper-lengthy wall of text about why everything else is wrong and I&rsquo;m right but instead I think I&rsquo;ll try something new.</p>

<p>A confession of sorts.</p>

<p>I have been trolling the ever-loving shit out of a family-friend&rsquo;s Facebook buddies. I&rsquo;ve been engaging in some ruthless back and forth political banter and it&rsquo;s been a blast. I originally wanted to engage in actual worthwhile discussion but soon realized that they would always resort to childish name calling and decided to have fun with it ever since. The wife hates it. And I don&rsquo;t even know why I keep at it. I just like watching them squirm and fall into the Decartes-esque sort of pseudo-logical circular reasoning. I find it fascinating that I can predict their reactions based on what I say. It&rsquo;s the perfect example of cronyism. Or at least a sample of the cronyism that the country is controlled by.</p>

<p>You couple that with my recent binge-listening to Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Common Sense and I&rsquo;m starting to see how the whole political system works. The short explanation is “It doesn&rsquo;t.” And yeah, teenage angsty rebel Derrick knew that but for some reason at 30 or so I wanted to REALLY know that.</p>

<p>The fun factor is that in the process, I&rsquo;ve learned who I am politically. And I&rsquo;ve alienated almost my entire family because of it. That post will be for another day but for now let&rsquo;s focus on what is next.</p>

<p>It was this morning during the “24 Hour Facebook Fallout Rule” when said family-friend and cronies where back-and-forthing about the Dallas police shooting and how the police finally used a drone to subdue him. I&rsquo;ve so far succeeded in not giving my 2 cents. But it&rsquo;s easier this time. And this is why.</p>

<p>I am a futurist. I absolutely adore the possibilities of what the future will have, and will look like. I hunger for that sort of Utopian version where we have reached post-scarcity and monetary gratification is no longer needed. We are a long way off. Automation is going to get there and it will pave the way but we need to be careful about it. Automation won&rsquo;t exist as long as capitalism does. Well, it can&rsquo;t. If it doesn&rsquo;t then we see 1% get hyper-rich and 99% get hyper-poor. Imagine 280 Donald Trumps running the House and Senate. It would be like that only more narcissistic.</p>

<p>Robotics is going to disrupt the country and the world. We can joke all we want about McDonald&rsquo;s replacing the $15-per-hourers with kiosks all we want but if we aren&rsquo;t going to prepare for the fallout that is unemployment that will surely follow we are digging an economic grave. Almost every job out there is as easily replaceable as the McDonald&rsquo;s cashier. If you don&rsquo;t realize that then you are an idiot.</p>

<p>Wat does this have to do with drones killing people? Aside from the fact that they have been doing that in the middle east for a few years now, this means that everything involving law enforcement changes. Those out they waving their gun rights in everyone&rsquo;s faces claiming that they should be able to shoot whomever they want if they trespass or look at them sideways just got a reality check. The 2nd amendment just got a little more fun. You have the right to bear arms but your arms will be substantially less affective against a remote control machine.</p>

<p>If Asimov needed a chapter zero to his laws of robotics, this is it. Everything changes now. You can say it was unfair. You can say the police should have subdued him with bodily force and stuffed him in a jail cell until it was time for lethal injection. You can say all you want, but you have to understand that law enforcement will never be the same. This is a beginning and complaining about your guns and my rights and showing pictures of your guns leaning up against the wall not killing anybody is not what we need to be doing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this will spur new laws but considering how Congress is twiddling their thumbs about encryption, this is gonna take a while. I think the best way to speed things up is if some black hat hacker came along and hijacked one of those drones. Kill two(or three) birds with one stone.</p>

<p>Maybe down the road, I&rsquo;ll cover the whole alienating bit and encryption as if that hasn&rsquo;t been picked apart clean already.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What happens now? I just finished wrapping up my last CIDM class and everything else is in order. I have one more class to take over the summer but I do get to walk on Saturday. So there is that. I&rsquo;m also finishing my entire college career with A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s because I tried.</p>

<p>So what now? I have a job lined up with the USDA but I also got a phone call from a staffing agency that needed a web developer position filled. After some sleuthing, it turns out that it was not a scam but there was just some oppsies with emails. That position offers twice what USDA is offering in the way of pay. Both jobs are temporary, but the web dev one is temp-to-hire. If they offer it to me, I kind of gotta take it but then I&rsquo;d be letting down the USDA folks who sent me an unofficial offer email the other day.</p>

<p>Then there was the web dev job for CSI that fell through but they still have a position opened that Babb mentioned today so I sent him an email that said toss my name in and let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll fill you in once I know what the hell is going on. I&rsquo;m gonna cut this short since I wanted to get started on re-learning PHP. I was gonna wait until next week but if not now, then never. Right?</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I decided to move this blog to my local computer instead of hosting the dev version on cloud 9. A version will stll be there but it will probably not get updated unless I have a reason to do otherwise. Since I&rsquo;m just pushing and not actually doing any sort of QC, this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue and I can set up another repo on my laptop.</p>

<p>I might consider adding an new method in my rakefile for pulling all the things based on my &ldquo;rake push&rdquo; one.</p>

<p>Other then that, I had wanted to write a blog post about how I feel that the MMO is dying after trying to play Ryzom after it got it&rsquo;s debut on Steam after being around for 12 years. I played it, felt very &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it and will probably play Cities: Skylines for the rest of the night. It&rsquo;s holding my attention more anyway. At least, when I&rsquo;m not chasing down bugs and glitches from mods.</p>

<p>In any case, this is  gonna be shorter anyway since it&rsquo;s more intended to be a teser post to see if I have everything plugged in properly.</p>

<p>Peace,

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello darkness, my old friend. Or rather oi to those who are still there and able to read something I write without being overly offended by crass observations of the politcal machine.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I wrote something for this little hacker-sheet blog but I have been having one hell for a semester as I work to tie up lose ends for a degree that will either be worth every penny or not.</p>

<p>I have fucked up in more ways then I care to admit in my online class and then that came through in a on-campus class, ironically taught by the same professor. I have forgotten to turn in 2 assignments, both of which were done a week before they were due, and I forgot to do a weekly busy-work assignment which counts as my drop assignment. Of course this happened before my professor made a decision to count all extra work that would otherwise be dropped towards our final grade in case we needed an extra push from a B to an A. Or in my case, from a D to a C.</p>

<p>So the past is behind us, right?</p>

<p>I chose 2 electives this semester to add a bit of zen to the otherwise chaotic months I knew were ahead. 1) Creative Writing: Poetry and 2) MCOM: Photography. Both have been an absolute blast. Halfway through my photography class, that professor started to give us a bit of creative wiggle room, which I being the pretentious/eccentric/asshole-ish/etc person that I have become, used to explore an avenue that I knew wasn&rsquo;t very known. Glitch Art is a very experimental and exploratory art style that involved literally breaking images and videos in such a way that they have digital artifacting and often, unexpected results. It&rsquo;s a style that looks awesome, creepy, surreal, and yet familiar. All at the same time. It&rsquo;s almost an homage to the last 30+ years of technological advancement on a personal level and that is what I find so intriguing about it. That NES game is fucked up and Mario is a blocking glitchy caricature of his former self? Fuck it, it&rsquo;s art now! I mean it has more depth then that but I like to imagine that happened in a cafe somewhere in the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In any case I fell into a style that I can only describe as pseudo-bending, where you take an image and run it through a glitching app on your phone. I think the app uses similar algorithms that standard pixel sorting software, or the like uses but has a more instant result. I borrowed from the styles that a Flickr photographer named Kai Rennert uses and added some filters and tweeted the contrast/saturation/etc to aim for this sort of old-timy feel of more modern imagery. It&rsquo;s an interesting approach to say the least but there is a fine line between art and Instagram filter. I&rsquo;m learning still.</p>

<p>Next up, my poetry class. I had a hard time coming up with a first poem for the class and ended up writing about my shitty ex girlfriend. My lovely wife got mad and we fought. So in an attempt at saving face, I said, &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll write every one after about you!&rdquo; And she said &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>It was a blast too.</p>

<p>Gutten-Trollen.</p>

<p>Every new style were learned became a challenge to tell a new chapter of our lives together and it worked out very well. Then I had to write a free verse at the end of the semester. I was like &ldquo;I got this&rdquo; since, well, I write free verse. But I ended up writing 2 separate ones, in very different styles, on top of starting the first one 3 different times, jotting down lines here and there in between bouts of writer&rsquo;s block, etc. I ended up writing a 3.5 page poem much in the same vein as Ginsberg. And just about died. I realized that should I use that one, it would create a lot of bad noise, so I opted for the shorter second one, written in the style that I traditionally use. It was cute and I went with that one. I let a classmate named Jason read my longform and he cried, hit me with said poem several times, said he hated me a dozen or so times, and then said I had to read that one instead. I had the professor print copies for me last minute and read it. I didn&rsquo;t get a standing ovation but I didn&rsquo;t get much of a response aside from reading it in the rambling manner that I did, take out commas when it won&rsquo;t break things, and that it was, in fact, Ginsberg-esque. I have it on another blog so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>

<p>In the end, my plan to write everything about my wife came through and now I&rsquo;m planning on turning it into a chapbook for our anniversary. I&rsquo;m gonna see about putting it into eFormat on Kindle too. Maybe sell it for $3 a pop.</p>

<p>Programming has been an absolute disaster. We have a flat tire in our group, which is too be expected but fuck that guy. He rubs Keith and I the wrong way. hasn&rsquo;t done any checkins on TFS, acts like RAM is the key to all computer issues, acts like he know the difference from a motherboard and a skateboard, and just overall sucks to be around. He&rsquo;s black so if you say anything at all that can be taken in anyway possible as racist, he acts like you just killed and fucked his mom. It&rsquo;s the worst. Say a bit of code is ghetto, and you are making fun of his upbringing, say my name is spelled in the way that I&rsquo;ve observed is commonly spelled by black folk and I just basically told him I wish his people were still slaves. It&rsquo;s the absolute worst and I don&rsquo;t think I like it all too much. One day I jokingly said, after fucking with broken ass code for about 3 hours straight &ldquo;this is why I don&rsquo;t believe in God.&rdquo; (which isn&rsquo;t why I don&rsquo;t btw&hellip;) And he responded with the fact that I can&rsquo;t be in the same room as him, otherwise he will just have to murder me (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here). Like, what? It&rsquo;s clearing in print in the first amendment that you can believe in whatever you want, so there is a chance that you will probably, at one point or another, associate with a non-believer. AND THAT IS OK! Seriously, life will continue. The world will be just fine, fanatics will still kill people, and the US gov will still be Capitalist. Shit will be fine, my friend.</p>

<p>On top of that, I just need to survive finals week, pick up these 3 last credit hours and start my job at the USDA on the 31st of May. It&rsquo;s a contract position but I get to hack around with Raspberry Pis and Linux for 12.50/hour. I would do that in the summer for free so I guess I win?</p>

<p>Over this semester, I&rsquo;ve lost my mind, drank 3423453 bottles of whiskey, rum, beer, water. Ate ramen and ribeye, ported a roguelike written in Python over to Linux, added conditional Pebble Time Round support to a watchapp written in C, got 2 websites sort of up, and made a few friends and enemies. I removed 30+ people on FB because I don&rsquo;t like them. I found out my DM unfollowed me and instead of becoming angry about it, I had a realization that I am also an asshole. I&rsquo;m unlikeable. It made me sad and now I&rsquo;m going through a bit of depression over it. It sucks but it might finally be my moment that i can finally get off FB. It&rsquo;s just toxic and Idk if I need to help with that. I&rsquo;m famously good at trolling people on there but it&rsquo;s no longer fun. I am at a point where now I post things as satire about myself. Like, I am making fun of me for fun. I figure, I can do this and only offend me,(It&rsquo;s almost impossible to offend me)</p>

<p>Idk, I need to move on. Things are changing and I don&rsquo;t want to become a product for my children on FB. I don&rsquo;t want the gov to have access to FB&rsquo;s face recognition software so they can keep tabs on my kids. It&rsquo;s not fair to them and you never know who Uncle Touch is. I guess that is a good way to finish this. Social Media has become a means for the gov to keep tabs on everyone. the NSA is still watching. Coarse location is a way of tracking you via your phone without GPS. It is used. All the time. By FB, Sprint, TWC, NSA, and the list goes on. Cortona wants to know your location on your desktop computer and that is fucking scary. We need a revolution. We need a new internet. We need P2P,. Encryption, FOSS, freedom, and basic rights. This can&rsquo;t continue. We need better education, not just in the classrooms but on the web. you shouldn&rsquo;t be a product for Big Cable, Big Oil, Big Advert. We need our lives back and we aren&rsquo;t going to do that by putting our children on shelves on FB without their fucking consent. Stop it.</p>

    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/02/22/socks-and-socialism</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sometimes think to hard on a subject so when I get around to wanting to write it, I&rsquo;ve at least mentally moved on. I&rsquo;ve never liked this about myself, because at least from a philosophical standpoint, my ideas help define me. They help me progress as a human and going back and looking at how I was at a given time allows me to understand myself better.</p>

<p>For example, barely over a decade ago, I used to be a very loud and proud atheist. I was very vocal about how awesome it was to not believe in a god. I was very up front about how believing in one made you stupid. I look back on that and realize how far I have come. I&rsquo;m always trying to be a better person, regardless of faith, education, or social status. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve started on a journey of trying to give back. It&rsquo;s hard but it can change you forever, when you get to that point where you can help and do it humbly. I never want a “thank you” from what I do but it&rsquo;s always nice to hear.</p>

<p>For almost a year now, I&rsquo;ve been helping in the kitchen at the in-law&rsquo;s church&rsquo;s Prayer Breakfast. We offer a warm breakfast for people who are homeless or in poverty. And really, anyone can come who wants a free meal. It&rsquo;s abundantly clear that we don&rsquo;t care where you come form.</p>

<p>On a side note, I remember a while back hearing a gentleman there telling someone that they don&rsquo;t even believe in God, they just show up for he free food. Guess what guy? That&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t believe either. I don&rsquo;t do this because God wants me to. I do this because I want to.</p>

<p>I was going to write about the success of our sock drive last week but got busy. School, wife, DnD, BuffTeks, and writing a video game, watchapp, whatever, tends to get in the way sometime. So on to the sock drive.</p>

<p>I gave up counting how many we ended up with after 1,077 pairs. We personally bought 4 packs of 10 pair. If we stick to handing out 2 pair per person, that ends up being enough for 20 people, and we gathered over 1 thousand. That&rsquo;s enough for 500 people. Only a bit more then 200 people showed up and pizza/bingo and we handed out a bit less per head. We still have a lot of socks left and Mark and I were worried about not getting enough. That blows my mind. Central always calls themselves a body, but they act more like a machine. They are brutally efficient at helping out the community. I wish more people were like that.</p>

<p>My next plan is hopefully going to be bigger, but it&rsquo;s still early in it&rsquo;s infancy while we try to figure out how to hand out the rest of these socks. I want to open a public garden for anyone who wants to harvest vegetables for free. When you look at the price of vegetables in the grocery store versus the price of seeds, it just makes sense that fruit and vegetables should move into a socialistic product. I don&rsquo;t have the math done right now but I can promise that the cost of planting seeds and watering plants is virtually free in the scheme of feeding the hungry. The only issues is finding land and finding people who will donate their time. America is Capitalistic by nature so Social Economics will be extremely hard to pull off even at this scale. I mean I can see people doing it for a short term but I want this to be sustainable as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet future blogs on this platform will start becoming more Socialistic in nature. I feel that is where my life is heading. I want to explore Socialism and this garden might be a good chance. The socks were.</p>

<p>That leads me to a idea that came from a discussion with my wife. She feels that people should give of their own accord, and I feel that they won&rsquo;t. The only people that generally give are religions people. And the church is getting smaller. Non-beleivers don&rsquo;t help by nature&rsquo;s design. A lot of believers only help reluctantly. The country isn&rsquo;t set up for social economics yet, but it could work. It does work. I almost think it might even happen naturally. Automation is going to change our entire existence. It&rsquo;s going to displace millions of workers decades at a time. A curious number suggests that in just 6 decades, we will see a global unemployment of 50%. conservatives say we will see new jobs, but I venture a guess that we will lose jobs a hell of a lot faster then we will gain. New jobs won&rsquo;t matter. If we lose these jobs to automation, and if longevity of life continues to increase, we are going to have to come up with some sort of alternative to the workforce. We need an alternative means to survival. Free food should be an option for survival.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost time for America to rethink what freedom is. It isn&rsquo;t living under the umbrella of materialism as a luxury. I deserve freedom and so do you. Hard work for money is a fleeting idea. It&rsquo;s time to move to a new economic existence where everyone is equal, regardless of their parents. It&rsquo;s time to remove social status. It&rsquo;s time to fix where our money goes.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got done watching a parody of Mr. Robot, where our favorite antagonist “hacks” his friend via SMS to ask for their Netflix credentials. Then as he is binge watching Making a Murder, he Hacked into Facebook to see what everyone is doing. The parody was really well done and my favorite part was when he hacked into the ma n' pa pizza site and found a co-u-pon bug in the system where he exploited it to receive discounted food.</p>

<p>Watch it. Youtube “Mr. Brobot.” It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>My friend has started a Jekyll blog much like how this blog runs. I&rsquo;m using Octopress for mine but it just sits on top of Jekyll so I&rsquo;m being pampered and he isn&rsquo;t. I donno how to go about doing a new post with just Jekyll but with Octopress it&rsquo;s a simple</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Yesterday I learned about materialism. I learned that in the US, you are allowed selective materialism. It&rsquo;s ok to look down upon people who have cars and watches you can&rsquo;t afford but phones don&rsquo;t count. A phone is not a materialistic thing because anti-materialists have smart phones. They also justify their phone by announcing how cheap or free it actually was. All-the-while being glued to it as if it&rsquo;s their portal to the world. They could live without it but it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything wrong with smart phones or materialism actually. I&rsquo;m in fact, very fond of technology and disposable incomes. It&rsquo;s one of the perk of living in the first world. When disposal income became a real thing in the 1910&rsquo;s and 20&rsquo;s we really went forward. We could afford cars and dishwashers AND pay for the occasional movie or enjoy any sort of luxury without much thought. How many times do we go out to eat? How often do we buy things on Amazon that we can do without?</p>

<p>So back to the materialism post. The post was implying that Rolexes and Mercedes and StarBucks don&rsquo;t make the person. And at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s just a watch, a car, and a Frappe Mocha Chai Latte with soy milk. My comment was intended to be a sarcastic joke that I suppose blew up. I made the joke that the post was “* sent from my iPhone.”</p>

<p>So what did I mean by that you might ask? Apparenty I meant that my family members all run out and buy new iPhones whenever the latest model comes out. I apparently meant that they just throw money at Apple like the company is some sort of fruit-oriented techno-prostotution congratulate. Because let&rsquo;s face it. They are. We even go as far as snorting cocaine off of our iPhone screens like little glass hooker butt cheeks.</p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. I meant that you live in, and enjoy a materialistic world, regardless of any shitpost you share on Facebook. I meant that regardless of if you are a penny pincher, or stingy or frugal or [insert synonym here] that you are, at the very least, a little bit materialistic. I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like an extremist: “Why not just walk everywhere if a car is such a burden on your pride?”, “Use the sun to tell the time of day.”, “Instead of Starbucks, just eat a pint of cheap non-cream-based ice cream every morning.” Nah, I wasn&rsquo;t implying that either.</p>

<p>My point was that It&rsquo;s a little bit hypocritical and shows envy to post something suggesting that things you actually don&rsquo;t own are what make someone materialistic while supporting that things you do own do not. You do not need a $700-$900 smart phone, but they sure are nice, huh? You could have opted for the cheapy budget phone but it wasn&rsquo;t as nice of specs. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still a phone. The post in question said the same thing about a car. A Mercedes is a nice luxury car, but in the end, you just need a car to get from one place to another. Couple this idea with the fact that Apple is marketed in the US as a luxury device. It&rsquo;s a Mercedes phone. It&rsquo;s a Starbucks phone. It&rsquo;s a Rolex phone. The same can be said for anyone who upgrades to the next $700-$900 flagship from Samsung each year. Why drive a Ford Galaxy when you could drive a Samsung Galaxy?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get that no one on Facebook understands my sarcasm. That&rsquo;s fine. I think a lot of what they post is stupid, wrong, weird, pedo-suggestive, whatever and sometimes it bugs me too. Facebook is intentionally designed to divide family and friends. It&rsquo;s the “meth that ruins the family” of the internet. Only instead of rotted teeth and acne, it&rsquo;s political extremism, breast feeding drama, agenda weirdness, and shitty sports memes.</p>

<p>So with that, if you want to post your shitposts about how bad materialism is from your expensive-ass iPhone 6 Plus or whatever, that&rsquo;s fine. Go for it. Enjoy your luxury device from your cheap ass car and your probably Starbucks, and drive to your salon to get a pedicure, and watch your streaming television and enjoy your T-Bone steak and Beats by Dre. Just never buy a Mercedes. Because materialism is bad.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This post isn&rsquo;t intended to be directed towards the family involved in the mentioned post. It&rsquo;s intended to bring a point about how we post things and only believe half-assed about the ideals behind it. That&rsquo;s an ingrained American trait. It happens all the time and isn&rsquo;t limited to the price point on cars, coffee, and watches. We are a lazy nation. That&rsquo;s fine. We are a wasteful and self-absorbed nation. That&rsquo;s probably not fine but c'est la vie. It&rsquo;s just the nature of things. We are trying to move away from Imperialism while globalization is growing and we are leaning towards a closed-wall fascism so it should only be right that we ignore the bad traits about us and focus on the good. We should only take things from the Bible that align with our personal interests. The same goes for politics. As we become more fascist in nature, we naturally shouldn&rsquo;t allow any outside influence on us. We should welcome the hyper-inflation that comes with bringing our factories back from overseas. After all, in the end, it should only be about us as long as we can make excuses for others and what others have. Right?</p>

    <link href="http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/10/when-we-walk/"/>
    
    <updated>2016-01-10T14:47:07-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/10/when-we-walk</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to write this for my other blog as I think the idea of it has switched gears, and maybe I will do that tomorrow but for now. Let&rsquo;s toss some ideas around. Tomorrow I am meeting with Mark Love to discuss the sock drive. He wants to know what brought me to want to do this and honestly, even though the concept behind it is simple, me coming this far is a bit more complex. I can just tell hims that I saw a statistic on a social sharing site that mentioned how of all the clothing items donated across the country, socks are least donated and yet, in most demand.</p>

<p>But that really isn&rsquo;t the whole story. Part is that I wanted to get a bunch of people together to do this, and asking non-Christians is out of the questions since they are more selfish with their financial wealth. That is also going along the idea that economically speaking, I think money is innately evil though, but that is a story for another day. Right, now we DO need money to function, but we shouldn&rsquo;t and part of our future relies on alternate means of wealth.</p>

<p>Regardless, money isn&rsquo;t the issue that drove me to this, and yes, the statistic was part of it but I think there was more to this idea. I was a part of the Blanket Amarillo thing, but won&rsquo;t be associating with the group that put that together. I was talking to Marli this morning and realized that you cannot help through advocay without actually helping by getting your hands dirty. Yelling at a bunch of guys intuits about blankets for the homeless all while shunning the most helpful group of people by constantly stating that you want to give the blankets without the church being involved is a bit ridiculous.</p>

<p>I have my suspicions that a few involved are only in it to advocate legalization of marijuana in Texas, and I am all for that but don&rsquo;t use the less fortunate as your stage to do so. That is a dick move if I have ever seen one.</p>

<p>In talking to Professor Hayward last semester, I have understood that the advocacy thing is a natural college student thing. Get out there and yell into your bullhorns and get heard. I get that. But again, unless you get your hands dirty and live with them, you have no idea of the conditions.</p>

<p>In the end, Blanket Amarillo is nothing more than a means of rebellion against authority and it doesn&rsquo;t help at all. We gave a few people some blankets and pillows and then went home. The law is the same and police can take the blankets still. Nothing changes via political involvement.</p>

<p>You change things by getting a hold of a group of people who want to change things. I know a group just like that. The church, regardless of what condition it is in, in the 21st century will always help. And they will do it in an organized manner, without the cameras and spotlights. Without a stage, and surely without some angsty college hubris.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I am going to tell Mark, as far as my story goes. I don&rsquo;t think I really even have one. I&rsquo;m an Atheist that wants to help the less fortunate and making breakfast (almost) every Sunday for them isn&rsquo;t just isn&rsquo;t cutting it anymore. He says that when people come to him with this sort of thing, the idea comes from the heart, always. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure it did, but weirdly enough, does it have to be spiritual?</p>

<p>Do I sit down at Leal&rsquo;s and start the conversation, “Why don&rsquo;t Atheists help out more?”  “Why are Atheists so fucking selfish that they can&rsquo;t donate a single ounce of effort to help here and there?” “Why is money so important to them?” I don&rsquo;t know if that is the best approach, but I&rsquo;m sure my faith, or lack there of, will come up. I think it&rsquo;s important that he know I am not a Christian, but I still want to help and be a part of the church.</p>

<p>Activism and advocacy is great and all, but there is more powerful means then sitting on the steps of a government building with a handful of blankets. You aren&rsquo;t going to change the world with some box guitars and pot fliers. I was going to get the Blanket Amarillo group involved in the sock drive as well, to finally cross that line drawn between Christians and Atheists, but like most Atheists, they aren&rsquo;t ready yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not lambasting them. If they want to continue to help in their own way, that is great. It&rsquo;s good to have foot soldiers on the war against poverty, but it won&rsquo;t help to not acknowledge that the church has done a lot of great things for the community. The church in a whole has done more then any of us can really grasp. But I think we, as Atheists, like to continue to cling on to the idea that the church is only trying to fill pews and look better in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>I know. I used to be that way too. But once you can let go of your Atheist pride, the veil becomes easier to remove. Then you realize that if you truly want to help, the church is a very important means of doing so. Christians simply want to help. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>“When We Walk” will be the name of my blog on my WordPress site as well, but it will focus on some other aspects of giving back and why we don&rsquo;t. Like this one, I have no idea how that one will go.</p>

    <link href="http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/08/new-year/"/>
    
    <updated>2016-01-08T09:45:13-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2016/01/08/new-year</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it&rsquo;s now 2016. That means a lot of stuff. Mainly, we survived the year, 2015. The year of the crybabies, hypersensetives, annoying agenda freaks, and a whole slew of wtfs. I try to keep in my mind that the world is less violent per statistics. We just have better coverage of things going on around hte globe. News travels faster as technology speeds up. News version of Moore&rsquo;s law?</p>

<p>Anywho, this year is gonna be better. I can feel it. I think. I&rsquo;m gonna stay way from FB-made drama and focus more on other outlets of social media. It&rsquo;s better that way. People are assholes and I don&rsquo;t need to be affected by them.</p>

<p>So new year, huh? I&rsquo;m trying new me this year. I don&rsquo;t have a set-in=stone resolution as much as a goal to end the year better then I started it. I&rsquo;ve started already. I installed my bidet yesterday and it&rsquo;s so nice. If you have never sprayed water at your butthole after taking a shit, I highly suggest you give it a whirl. It&rsquo;s jsut fantastic. I also got my ergo keyboard yesterday. It&rsquo;s hard to get used to but I hope it works out for me. My only real issue is that it doesn&rsquo;t fit on my keyboard tray properly. Other than that, after typing a while on it it feels weird going to my mouse. The hotkeys are a nice touch though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently at a wall on my watch app, but more on that later on in another post.</p>

<p>Other new me stuff? I am finishing my school stuff this year. I opted for photography instead of data mining since it doesn&rsquo;t have a book. DM was online but I don;t think I will end up employed before the semester is over so that is fine. I just need to get out and shoot every now and then.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&rsquo;m only taking one CIS class this semester and it&rsquo;s the sucky one. Babb is becoming the source of my anxiety and high blood pressure and I&rsquo;m ready to be done with these classes.</p>

<p>One last thing. New me also included growing a beard. Or rather, On Jan 1 I decided I didn&rsquo;t feel like shaving. So far it almost looks like a beard. We&rsquo;ll see how long it goes.</p>

<p>Anywho. I got other things to do and I need to teach myself how to type again since this keyboard has a learning curve.</p>

<p>At that, deuces!</p>

    <link href="http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2015/12/31/last-day-on-earth/"/>
    
    <updated>2015-12-31T11:40:29-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://http://androidhell.github.io/blog/2015/12/31/last-day-on-earth</id>
    
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here we go. Today is the last day of 2015 and my last day at FP. Aside from not doing much work-type work over the last couple of months I have actually kept myself busy learning new things and honing some skills. One example of what I have learned is in this very blog. It&rsquo;s OctoPress, built off of Jekyll, and using Ruby on Rails. I host this site through Github and it&rsquo;s all pretty swanky. Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll post what the site looks like from the backend to put it in to perspective.</p>

<p>Other things I have learned this year and since being at FP are, some Rails, a bit more PHP, a lot of WordPress magic and some JavaScript stuff. Failed at learning Objective C and Python. But I am actually using Python for a project at the moment. I posted about it yesterday. More on that in a bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve severed ties with some people this year. I&rsquo;ve been working on being less toxic as a human being and that involved cutting out the toxic in other people, and thus, cutting out those people. Aaron could be a great person if he would just accept that other people are different and that is fine. The world is working in favor of equality, including the rights of homosexuals and he can&rsquo;t see that behind a veil of bigotry for bigotry&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;ve learned a while ago that if people think different from you. That&rsquo;s fine. They don&rsquo;t decide your fate. You do. I&rsquo;ve also learned that there is a huge difference between being an Atheist and being an Anti-Christian. When you go out of your way to antagonize believers and turn it on themselves when they speak up, you are a horrible person. No amount of &ldquo;look at how bad they are&rdquo; will make you look any better. I do want to write full piece on this but donno which blog it is better suited for. It&rsquo;s a very shitshow topic. It&rsquo;ll probably end up there after my Future of Economy piece.</p>

<p>The others I have cut out, I&rsquo;m not very worried about either. It was an occasional Facebook like, share, comment, whatever. And that means absolutely nothing to me. I was never even friends with Jessica to begin with. She is a very toxic person and I don&rsquo;t need that. At all.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have been more helpful in regards to the less fortunate and plan on getting more involved. We are doing a sock drive in February and I want to try to get the non-faith activists involved if I get the chance via Blanket Amarillo. I donno where to go from there but my end goal is probably awareness and a sense of unity, regardless of what you believe in. You shouldn&rsquo;t use your faith as an excuse to help the needy, and neither should you use your lack of faith. I don&rsquo;t like what that message can send. All it will do is create a disconnect in our society in a sea of disconnect.</p>

<p>So I really, like REALLY want noodles tonight. And if I have any say in that I&rsquo;m getting some damn red curry and rice sticks and a boiled egg. After that is NYE planning. The Fox clan is doing a thing but idk if I wanna go. I always feel alienated and I definitely feel like &ldquo;that guy who knows computers.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t wanna be that guy anymore. It&rsquo;s a freaking hobby. I don&rsquo;t call the wife, &ldquo;that chick who knows yarn&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t call my dad &ldquo;that guy who knows cars.&rdquo; Computers is hobby, and as such, I am better at them computers, but I no longer care to wear it as a badge. I&rsquo;m still working on my reaction when someone doesn&rsquo;t understand a simple task though. That&rsquo;s a toughie.</p>

<p>I think tomorrow I&rsquo;ll post a New Year&rsquo;s Resolution blog so that will have to wait.</p>

<p>On to the goods!</p>

<p>I have a pretty functional prototype of my watch app. I&rsquo;m borrowing heavily from the Commander for Pebble but plan on rewriting everything from the ground up to work for what I need. For now, it&rsquo;s a scrollable interface but I want to change it to use Up, Down and Settings button clicks and longpresses instead. The first version as of last night about 9:45 and 2 glasses of whiskey does actually work though. And a surprise was that voice commands work extremely well. I don&rsquo;t know if I want voice commands for an app intended for music but I might keep it. It&rsquo;ll add that secret agent aspect that a lot of smartwatch enthusiasts like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hosting the HTML bits on this blog actually. I made a new route for it at <a href="http://androidhell.github.io/settings/.">http://androidhell.github.io/settings/.</a> You can go there but without an Android and a Pebble&hellip; and a Linux machine&hellip; and Pithos, it won&rsquo;t do much. That&rsquo;s another fear of mine. This is so niche that I don&rsquo;t know if anyone will care. I want to add OS X and Windows support later and aside from learning how to add python and Pithos to either of those OS&rsquo;s, it should be fairly straightforward. I would just need to test it. A major thing is that it uses media controls so it isn&rsquo;t necessarily a Pithos app. I could rebrand it for other music applications but might need to compile a tested list so people don&rsquo;t freak out. An example is that if you have the Spotify client, it should work fine but from my experience, Pithos tends to hijack controls over other players. Simple solution would be to just run a single app.</p>

<p>More on this as it develops.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have 5 more hours left as Senior Web Surfer at FP. I&rsquo;ve cleaned out my computer and sent some code stuff  to my Drive account to sift through later. I removed programs with my accounts tied to them except Chrome. I&rsquo;ll uninstall it right before I leave. I know they won&rsquo;t do anything but I&rsquo;d rather not have a trail to all my online activities since Google uses syncing across computers.</p>

<p>This year is almost over. Time to start working on what to do about next year. 2016 will probably be a shitshow but I may be surprised.</p>

<p>Everything is a mess. I need to hire a maid. I want to have a working version up by the weekend. We will see how that goes. V2 will have the button configs but v1 will have scrollable commands.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the title is a bit hyperbolic but it still sounds cool. I took yesterday off because I was sick (cough, cough) and stayed in my pjs, playing video games and watching movies with the wifey. It was nice but laundry still isn&rsquo;t done yet. Bleh.</p>

<p>Last week at Financial Payments and no word yet on IT job opportunity. Still hoping but not holding my breath. School is going to be upon us again soon anyway. I need to finalize my classes and get my books ordered. I&rsquo;m worried about finances this last semester. If I don&rsquo;t have a job lined up by May, I&rsquo;m afraid of what might happen next. Damn robots taking mah jobs!</p>

<p>Robots? I meant Mexicans&hellip; yeah.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently tinkering with some Linux automation with my Pebble at home but can&rsquo;t get my watch to connect to the server. Waiting on a reply from the dev of the program. It&rsquo;s definitely the watch app since my server boots. I get /GET 200 fine.</p>

<p>I think after this week, I might stream some games next week. Maybe go through some more obscure titles and support that Linux-y thingy. Other than that I need to et back to my other blog. I want to finish the piece on refugees and then start on a bit about how old politics is destroying the technology age.</p>

<p>The refugee piece might only be 1 more post&hellip;</p>

<p>I don’t want to dwell any more on it.</p>

<p>Anywho, Ralkkai, out.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>o the Fox clan did Christmas early this year due to family being in and out of town at various times. We broke tradition of mountains of food and ordered Jason&rsquo;s Deli instead. I got a Reuben and asked for a lighter portion so they only gave me 3 lbs of corned beef. That was nice of them.</p>

<p>Toys? I got some new shinies. First I got a Steam Controller. I wanted it not for a daily driver as much as to just test and mess with. I wanted to see what Valve had to offer as far as hardware. Turns out, aside from a steep learning curve, they have a lot of innovations or gimmicks to offer. I say both because if you like it, it&rsquo;s an innovation and if you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a gimmick. (SEE: Samsung Galaxy series.) So first thing would be the touchpads. It did away with a D-pad and a right joystick for some rather fancy technology. Thing having two concaved laptop mousepads. But take it a step further and go with Apple&rsquo;s multi-touch pressure sensitive one. They are fully programmable, have haptic feedback, based on thumb acceleration, and can act as a touch or a click. It&rsquo;s hard to explain beyond that.</p>

<p>The triggers are duel-programmable, similar to the XBox ones where a half pull registers differently from a full pull. The bottom buttons are absolutely fantastic. I can see them adding a bit of immersion for FPS games. Left for reloading and right for scope. You don&rsquo;t have to fumble with clunky controls like on PS or XBox. The face buttons are a reach, like some reviews said. Once you get used to it though, I don&rsquo;t think it will be bad. Think of the XBox left stick reach. They are positioned about there.</p>

<p>The coup de grâce though&hellip; The gyroscopic motion controls. Hungh! I messed with Porta 2 a bit this morning and the Steam-default config is set up in such a way that you aim with the right pad but as your thumb is on it, you also aim with motion controls. Why Nintendo didn&rsquo;t do this with the Wii, I will never know. It will take some getting used to but it&rsquo;s pretty freaking cool.</p>

<p>Other things I got: Cookie butter (because I&rsquo;m a fat kid at heart), a 5.1 surround sounds speaker set (I want to connect them to my computer but if I can&rsquo;t get it to work with Linux, then TV it is.), several watchbands for various occasions along with some quick release pins with are a godsend, and some other stuff like a Tux t-shirt, some gift cards and a power bank for my devices. 13,000mAh baby! My phone will be charged for a full day now!</p>

<p>The family is doing family stuff today and I am at work, waiting out the next week and a half. Still nothing to do. I think I&rsquo;ll continue watching the web dev videos and start working through the PHP/MySQL/JavaScript book I got for Christmas as well.</p>

<p>Anyway, time to do something else besides typing this.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I should be doing other things but instead I&rsquo;ve been working on a new theme for my aging LG G2. I wanted to do a single page layout and then after using KWGT, I ended up messing a bit with KWLP and of course. that is where the rabbit hole started.</p>

<p>I am still stuck on the Flattington theme since I&rsquo;m still stuck on a Beta of PA so if I use any other theme the navbar painting glitches and stays maroon. Instead of feeling stuck with it, I improvised. I built a new theme around the maroon and green and it looks pretty good, imho.</p>

<p>Anyway, I started playing with Kustom and ended up working on a Material Design-inspired animation that has 2 shapes come from top and bottom and a fab button fills out. The animations are sleek abut I&rsquo;m using Apex and can&rsquo;t figure out how to get the transition of the home screen to work with it. I&rsquo;ll continue working on it in my free time and eventually abandon it. I don&rsquo;t even know what to do next with it.</p>

<p>Also, totally off topic but I bought Saint&rsquo;s Row IV last night since it finally got ported. I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with it and it is very much scratching my car sandbox itch. The game is fun and I&rsquo;m upset that I took so long to check it out. One more port to Linux though. This year was looking bleak for Linux gaming with the depressing release of Steam Machines but this last month has been looking better.</p>

<p>Also, get to do X-Mas tonight which is cool. I get to play with my toys early!</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weekend is over and it was fairly busy. I spent Friday with the wife putting the tree up. Did the gift shopping on Saturday and got most stuff wrapped on yesterday. Went to church and talked to Alan and Mark L. about doing the sock drive and as it stands, we are looking at doing it on a dinner night on Feb 13. Announcements will be put in the bulletin.</p>

<p>Things I still need to do before the month is out: I need to get the old blogspot blog shut down. Might just leave it and let it rot on the digital vine, tbh. I also need to continue on my series on the WP blog. I&rsquo;m considering designing a POV app for Android to work with a drone if I get one for X-Mas. I have no idea where to start though.</p>

<p>I guess there isn&rsquo;t much to talk about today. I have no idea what I am going to do this week at work. It&rsquo;s really starting to drain me not having anything to do and just letting the next 2 weeks run out like this. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a new web project to work on until then. I donno  what though. All my next project ideas would be better suited for home.</p>

<p>My brother bought me Wither 2 for X-Mas. I was reluctant to grab it since it&rsquo;s an eON port but after testing Bioshock: Infinite at medium settings and it running fine, I decided to add W2 to my wishlist. Then he bought it. It&rsquo;s more his game but I&rsquo;ve been enjoying it so far.</p>

<p>Donno what else to say.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Magic Panel</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost done with the rails tutorial and think I have a plan for the app itself. I want to offer it to empeopled.com as a sort of self-contained friend-feed. I was struck by just how close the community was when I was helping a user tweak his Chrome extension for the site. I&rsquo;ll probably post about that when/if he ever gets it to github. He said he wants to work out the kinks before he feels it&rsquo;s ready for the public to use. He wants the features fleshed out.</p>

<p>With that said, I made a thing. It&rsquo;s still a bit clunky but it does what I think it is supposed to so let&rsquo;s call this an impromptu guide on said thing. So, I like Bootstraps responsive navbar, and I like making it a sidebar instead. I also like having a sticky side-panel and the news feed on the other side. In Bootstrap speak, you have your core profile info in a md-col-4 and the actual news feed in a md-col-8. The sidebar won&rsquo;t move but the feed will on mouse scroll. The catch is that you maintain Bootstrap&rsquo;s responsive behavior all the while. It got real tricky, real fast. Let&rsquo;s jump in, shall we?</p>

<p>The hard part first: I have all my Javascript in a file called extras.js so I can keep track of my own JS and keep it separate from the stuff required/generated for Rails. The full JS file is as follow:</p>

<p>This uses some JQuery magic to affix whatever I use the #MyNav on it&rsquo;s div. It&rsquo;s similar to using static versus fixed in CSS. but it works with the responsive nature of the site.  So we tuck that into the extras.js file and move on to our HTML which will be the easier part:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;row&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-spy=</span><span class="s">&quot;affix&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-offset-top=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- side panel goes here v--&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/aside&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;col-md-8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c">&lt;!-- page content goes here --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we have the md-col-4 and md-col-8 that I mentioned earlier. Bootstrap uses these to segregate the content for your own amusement and manipulation. Our profile content goes in the -4 and our feed, in the -8. Once we have the Bootstrap logic set up, we can then add our bit of JQuery to the HTML with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">data-spy=</span><span class="s">&quot;affix&quot;</span> <span class="na">data-offset-top=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p> This added the affix function along with a data-offset function that we set to &ldquo;0&rdquo; to keep the div in the same place when we scroll. If you set it to another number it will be positioned differently. On some monitors/browsers, you may notice the div flicker on scroll and occasionally it will scroll and catch and with that said, this isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it does work.</p>

<p>The final bit of magic is using 2 Bootstrap media queries for the separate screen sizes. This bit was hard to get right and took an hour or two of tinkering and crashing my virtual server on Cloud 9 several times. When you spam edit/save the CSS it loads the RAM and then it takes a shit. It&rsquo;s a limit of having a server with only 512 MB of RAM for a dev environment I guess. Anyway, the CSS:</p>

<p>We start by setting a fixed width for the .affix class because it will resize on scroll otherwise. I never figured out why it naturally wants to change the entire section&rsquo;s size but it does so we fix it to the same width of the &lt;aside&gt; and it stays put. We then add two important media queries that will keep things at a correct spot on different screen sizes. The goal was to have a side-panel for most/all computer screens but go into a single column on tablet and mobile screens.
The first query looks like I arbitrarily used 293px but I came up with that after a series of trials and errors of resizing the browser until it behaved properly. This is for smaller desktop/laptop screens. The second query is for going into a single column, indicated by width: 100%; for both the .affix and .micropost classes.</p>

<p>Now that we have all the pieces in place, you should have a functioning responsive-fixed-hybrid page along with all your other Bootstrappy magic.</p>

<p>The only real caveat here is that if you are using Turbolinks/Jquery-Turbolinks, the scripts won&rsquo;t work unless you reload the entire page. As, the saying goes, that just isn&rsquo;t the Rails way. We have a full site built on _partials and all sorts of modular pieces and we haven&rsquo;t come this far to get hung up by a stupid page refresh. The onl solution I found to fix Javascript stopping on a link click was to remove the Turbolinks and JQuery-Turbolinks  gems altogether including deleting them from application.js. The other fixes I found didn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, this was my attempt at a guide. Sorry about any confusion ahead of time. Happy coding!</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Errors. Errors everywhere.</p>

<p>As I was working through the TC stuff last night and finishing up user validation and testing whether users could masquerade as other users, I stumbled headlong into what I will call my 3rd bug hell of this project. The problem with being human is that you are incredibly prone to error. It&rsquo;s in our very nature to screw stuff up. It&rsquo;s that deciding factor that will forever separate us from machines. Sure some machines break down but that&rsquo;s just poor design or manufacturing by a human more than it is wear and tear. (There is still a measurable amount of w&amp;t in machinery, I know but it&rsquo;s not as significant as , say a DOA hard drive from an oversight or mistake made by the person running the hard drive making machines.)</p>

<p>I digress. I was working through the book code to finish the user integration testing and had a handful of errors that were easy to fix. Just had to deal with a rabbit hole of them. Then right as I was finishing the first section of chapter10, I did another &lsquo;rake test&rsquo; and hit this handful of errors that I couldn&rsquo;t even figure out what the messages were meaning. On  Cloud 9, in the terminal, you can click on the file path related to the error and tell it to open the file and it will direct you to the exact line of code. Easy enough to check on stuff. But the problem lies in the fact that even though that line might be what is erroring out, it is doing so from another bit of code that it is pulling from. Say you wrote a method and had a logical error or a typo in it. In this hypothetical, the controller using that method from your &lsquo;helper&rsquo; file would show the error. You can state at that line all day long and decide it is correct as hell, or you can follow the rabbit trail of what you just did to get there. This is where Eclipse and Visual Studio excel at because they have the function of stepping through while debugging. This is probably why I make use either Eclipse or Aptana to develop locally from now on. Or, at the very least, debug in one of those two, but keep Sublime Text as my main dev too so things stay light and crisp.</p>

<p>I worked on fighting those bugs for about 3 hours and finally figured out that I had a line of code that was logging in the user, then going into an &lsquo;if/else&rsquo; and the first thing it was doing was logging in the user again. My errors said nothing about the user being logged in twice or anything closely resembling that message. The worst part about it is that it was a simple oversight on my part. After that I was down to 1 error, which I finally found to be a typo. Cleaned that up and had another typo right after that line. Again, cleaned up and ran another test and everything came out green.</p>

<p>What annoys me is that it isn&rsquo;t as simple as saying &ldquo;Hey, this is what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s following hte trail and actually knowing your code. Make comments that tell you where this thing is coming from or going to. Make a flow chart if need be. A mechanic doesn&rsquo;t just hop under the car without knowing point A and point B of the exhaust system.</p>

<p>Errors now gone, I should be ready to set up password reset stuff, which will be a journey in itself. Then after that, we can start finally working on the main feature of the project; posting user generated content.</p>

<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m also considering calling the final project an alpha but starting from scratch and rebuilding everything based on my knowledge from both projects. I would really like to implement paperclip and devise into the TC and also redo the entire styling. I might come up with soem doodles later on on what I&rsquo;m imagining.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m skipping workout to focus on code this morning. I&rsquo;m working on EC for the time being and wanted to write a quick followup to the whole devise gem praise I gave yesterday. The gem is great for automating all your authentication needs but according to the author of the guide on Udemy, it isn&rsquo;t easy to re-style the alert messages to reflect those of actual Bootstrap. He wrote a weird bit of voodoo magic that accomplishes that.</p>

<p>He placed this bit of crazy right above the &lt;% yield %> tag that displays the pay content. Since this is in application.html.erb it will be able to function on all pages.</p>

<p>On reflection, it is really interesting that a developer can take something as complicated as authentication and form validation and wrap it up into a nice little import-able lib/gem and someone else can point out a single &ldquo;unfixable&rdquo; flaw and write some code that acts as a standalone fix.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Fixed the applicatoin.html.erb code to show green on success and red on error. The code from the guide was for a previous version of Rails and stuff got changed and it treated a bit differently in the version I am using (v. 4.2.1).</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am currently on chapter 10 of the Hartl book with the Twitter clone and about halfway through the Etsy clone. I think for the time being I will call them TC and EC, respectively. I learned a very interesting thing about Rails sine I am working on the 2 projects in tandem. There is an easy way and a hard way in Rails.</p>

<p>I spent about 4-5 hours working through the login stuff for TC because Hartl has you do it all by hand. Now, that covers the gambit. Logging in, logging out, signing up, etc. It also covers form validation which is a very important aspect of web apps and sites in today&rsquo;s current state of internet. We don&rsquo;t yet have an internet ID we can use for everything. Maybe an internet driver&rsquo;s licence will be a future project.</p>

<p>So Hartl grinds it out the old fashioned way, and mind you, Rails is fairly stream-lined compared to ASP.NET or other MVC environments that I am aware of. But the Udemy video tutorial guy is awesomely lazy and is like, there&rsquo;s a gem that handles all the logging in. You just gotta grab it, bundle install, and the configure the gem for your application. After that, it creates all the routes for you and it&rsquo;s a matter of plugging the routes into the forms you build from scratch. And I mean you can barely even call that &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;About&quot;, pages_about_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="err">&lt;</span>%= link_to &quot;Contact&quot;, pages_contact_path %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>is all you really need to do. The gem has already built the pages that those pieces of code link to. It&rsquo;s very elegant to say the least. All that you really need to do is some CSS/Bootstrap-y magic to get it looking nice.</p>

<p>I still got some more understanding definitely and I don&rsquo;t think I will ever fully know all of it, but at least I am getting to the point where I can crate something usable. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up the chapter I&rsquo;m currently on on the EC project in the morning. I think I&rsquo;m going to relax tonight and play some video games. I recently picked up Papo &amp; Yo and it is one of the most endearing and sad puzzle games I have ever played. I think I already figured out the overarching story/tone based on the little dedication splash right before you start playing. Sad subject but interesting that the developer got out his emotions in such a unique way. I would have just written a shitty poem and cries a little.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intro first? My name is Derrick Shaw. I am 32 years old and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. Or rather, this is intended to be an ongoing documenting of thoughts as I work on my webapp project. This doc is sort of my &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; opposite the machine code side of things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m, is some ways, becoming an accidental programmer. I never planned on learning how to develop software, and honestly, wanted to be an IT specialist. A TL;DR of how I got here:</p>

<blockquote><p>I fucked up a lot in my 20&rsquo;s. I spent the entire time drinking and doing softcore drugs. Mainly gas station speed and marijuana. I skipped out on going to college after high school because I thought I could make a living in the factories. Well, the factories fell when the economy did and I was out of a job. Jumped around in temp jobs for a while, moved to AZ, fucked that up, moved back to IN, lived in my parent&rsquo;s basement in an alcohol-induced haze for a few months, then moved to TX after meeting my now wife.
Her family outed me for the loser that I was and at some point between working at a local gas station and a local Taco Bell at the age of 27, I decided I needed to fix myself.
I went to a revolving door 9 month-degree-type college that was more of a storefront racket to make money off of the poverty-stricken inner-city community. Joke on them was, I learned a shit ton about computers in the process. Problem being, the piece of paper they called a diploma waasn&rsquo;t taken seriously in the field I was intending to go into.
So I went to an actual college. On Day 0, I told the adviser I wanted to work on computer networks for a living and she figured that meant Computer Science. I found out real fast that I wasn&rsquo;t cut out to be a math/computer nerd. Talked to a man about picking my next semester classes and told him about the horrible professor I had who tried teaching me Python like the Nazis tried teaching the french about real estate. The man, who became known as Dr. Babb/Babb-arooni/Babb-alicious/The Babbs/etc pulled me over to Computer Information Systems, which is fancy speak for web design and software development.
I&rsquo;m 1 year away from graduating now and Babb has taken a liking to me via my dedication and hard-working demeanor.  I still don&rsquo;t know very much about programming but I do what I need to survive.
I got offered an internship this summer and it is in software development. The company uses Ruby on Rails and Java for most of what they do. I have little knowledge in Java and zero in Rails at the point of my hiring.
And here we are. So when you have barely an understanding of programming and very little knowledge of Java, save for what you did in your free time in app development for Android, and you have absolutely zero knowledge of Ruby or Rails, what do you do?  You build a social media site, that&rsquo;s what. What surprised me about myself is that in other situations, I would start a thing, get a barebones understanding, and then stop. But what I did differently this time is I created a framework for a potentially living, breathing system, on the net. This gives me an obligation to see it through.</p></blockquote>

<p>I must be blunt at this point. I am working through Michael Hartl&rsquo;s Rails Tutorial book at <a href="www.railstutorial.org">https://www.railstutorial.org</a> so my idea isn&rsquo;t wholly original. What is original is where I plan on expanding. Well, that too is a lie. I will be borrowing from the best pieces of the most popular social media sites to create what I hope to be a good social experience. I also want to keep out all the annoying things that keep people from enjoying social media. (e.g., games ads, spam, paid features, etc.)</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas and I will share them as they start to see daylight but for now, I wanted to use this space on the net as sort of a way for me to get my thoughts out when they happen, or more specifically, when I get the chance.</p>

<p>In the future, this may very well become my developmental cliffnotes, but for now, let&rsquo;s just mark this up as a personal journal as I struggle though the world of social media development.</p>

<p>I will link to the site once Alpha hits. I will also come up with a version numbering and naming scheme before then. Alphas will probably be numbers 0.0.x and Betas will be 0.x.x but I haven&rsquo;t decided on a name scheme. For now it is just going by Project Kwikr, which is very obviously a mutation of the word &lsquo;quicker&rsquo;.</p>
