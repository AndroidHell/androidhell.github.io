This is my little blogspace using Octopress so I can impress my friends and random hipsters at coffeeshops with my amazing hacking skills.

&amp;about-me&rg;I'm struggling to understand anything related to programming even though yo ucan clearly see in my github repo that I have done some stuff. I'm originally from Indiana but am now stuck in the great nation of Texas. I'm going into my final semester of college at WTAMU and I couldn't be more happy/scared/annoyed/exhausted/ansty about it. 

I have worked with HTML, CSS, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, SQL, and NoSQL. I've dabbled in Python and failed hard at leanring Objective C. Every time I try to learn anything related t ocoding, I end up giving up and moving to something new. Which is why I'm bascailly cut out for front-end web design. Programming for programmers that never made it!&lt;/about-me&rg;

&lt;free-time&gt;I am usually tinkering with some sort of computer shenanigans. I'm a loud and proud Linux nerd. I'm an indie gamer becasue it's better than the alternative. I love beer, coffee, and horror movies.&lt;/free-time&gt;
