I want to write this for my other blog as I think the idea of it has switched gears, and maybe I will do that tomorrow but for now. Let's toss some ideas around. Tomorrow I am meeting with Mark Love to discuss the sock drive. He wants to know what brought me to want to do this and honestly, even though the concept behind it is simple, me coming this far is a bit more complex. I can just tell hims that I saw a statistic on a social sharing site that mentioned how of all the clothing items donated across the country, socks are least donated and yet, in most demand.

But that really isn't the whole story. Part is that I wanted to get a bunch of people together to do this, and asking non-Christians is out of the questions since they are more selfish with their financial wealth. That is also going along the idea that economically speaking, I think money is innately evil though, but that is a story for another day. Right, now we DO need money to function, but we shouldn't and part of our future relies on alternate means of wealth.

Regardless, money isn't the issue that drove me to this, and yes, the statistic was part of it but I think there was more to this idea. I was a part of the Blanket Amarillo thing, but won't be associating with the group that put that together. I was talking to Marli this morning and realized that you cannot help through advocay without actually helping by getting your hands dirty. Yelling at a bunch of guys intuits about blankets for the homeless all while shunning the most helpful group of people by constantly stating that you want to give the blankets without the church being involved is a bit ridiculous. 

I have my suspicions that a few involved are only in it to advocate legalization of marijuana in Texas, and I am all for that but don't use the less fortunate as your stage to do so. That is a dick move if I have ever seen one.

In talking to Professor Hayward last semester, I have understood that the advocacy thing is a natural college student thing. Get out there and yell into your bullhorns and get heard. I get that. But again, unless you get your hands dirty and live with them, you have no idea of the conditions. 

In the end, Blanket Amarillo is nothing more than a means of rebellion against authority and it doesn't help at all. We gave a few people some blankets and pillows and then went home. The law is the same and police can take the blankets still. Nothing changes via political involvement. 

You change things by getting a hold of a group of people who want to change things. I know a group just like that. The church, regardless of what condition it is in, in the 21st century will always help. And they will do it in an organized manner, without the cameras and spotlights. Without a stage, and surely without some angsty college hubris. 

I don't know what I am going to tell Mark, as far as my story goes. I don't think I really even have one. I'm an Atheist that wants to help the less fortunate and making breakfast (almost) every Sunday for them isn't just isn't cutting it anymore. He says that when people come to him with this sort of thing, the idea comes from the heart, always. I mean, I'm sure it did, but weirdly enough, does it have to be spiritual?

Do I sit down at Leal's and start the conversation, “Why don't Atheists help out more?”  “Why are Atheists so fucking selfish that they can't donate a single ounce of effort to help here and there?” “Why is money so important to them?” I don't know if that is the best approach, but I'm sure my faith, or lack there of, will come up. I think it's important that he know I am not a Christian, but I still want to help and be a part of the church. 

Activism and advocacy is great and all, but there is more powerful means then sitting on the steps of a government building with a handful of blankets. You aren't going to change the world with some box guitars and pot fliers. I was going to get the Blanket Amarillo group involved in the sock drive as well, to finally cross that line drawn between Christians and Atheists, but like most Atheists, they aren't ready yet. 

I'm not lambasting them. If they want to continue to help in their own way, that is great. It's good to have foot soldiers on the war against poverty, but it won't help to not acknowledge that the church has done a lot of great things for the community. The church in a whole has done more then any of us can really grasp. But I think we, as Atheists, like to continue to cling on to the idea that the church is only trying to fill pews and look better in the eyes of the public. 

I know. I used to be that way too. But once you can let go of your Atheist pride, the veil becomes easier to remove. Then you realize that if you truly want to help, the church is a very important means of doing so. Christians simply want to help. There is nothing wrong with that.

“When We Walk” will be the name of my blog on my WordPress site as well, but it will focus on some other aspects of giving back and why we don't. Like this one, I have no idea how that one will go.
