This is my first post so I felt it was obvious that I should title it "Hello World."

I'm hoing to use this as my official platform for writing out my experiences in the programming world.

If this dies, then it dies.

I'm going to work on setting up this site's styling and get a proper about me page up before I delve further into things.

This will aslo be a chance for me to further explore markdown since my knowledge is limited to what little I have done on github and commenting on reddit. 

Until I have mroe to say I will leve off at this point.

This is my attempt a maintaining a developer space on my github via Octopress, basically because it's cool and all the hipsters are gonna be jealous of my hacky blog skills.

At that, I say, Goodbye World!
