The weekend is over and it was fairly busy. I spent Friday with the wife putting the tree up. Did the gift shopping on Saturday and got most stuff wrapped on yesterday. Went to church and talked to Alan and Mark L. about doing the sock drive and as it stands, we are looking at doing it on a dinner night on Feb 13. Announcements will be put in the bulletin.

Things I still need to do before the month is out: I need to get the old blogspot blog shut down. Might just leave it and let it rot on the digital vine, tbh. I also need to continue on my series on the WP blog. I'm considering designing a POV app for Android to work with a drone if I get one for X-Mas. I have no idea where to start though.

I guess there isn't much to talk about today. I have no idea what I am going to do this week at work. It's really starting to drain me not having anything to do and just letting the next 2 weeks run out like this. Maybe I'll find a new web project to work on until then. I donno  what though. All my next project ideas would be better suited for home.

My brother bought me Wither 2 for X-Mas. I was reluctant to grab it since it's an eON port but after testing Bioshock: Infinite at medium settings and it running fine, I decided to add W2 to my wishlist. Then he bought it. It's more his game but I've been enjoying it so far. 

Donno what else to say.
