So the title is a bit hyperbolic but it still sounds cool. I took yesterday off because I was sick (cough, cough) and stayed in my pjs, playing video games and watching movies with the wifey. It was nice but laundry still isn't done yet. Bleh.

Last week at Financial Payments and no word yet on IT job opportunity. Still hoping but not holding my breath. School is going to be upon us again soon anyway. I need to finalize my classes and get my books ordered. I'm worried about finances this last semester. If I don't have a job lined up by May, I'm afraid of what might happen next. Damn robots taking mah jobs!

Robots? I meant Mexicans... yeah.

I'm currently tinkering with some Linux automation with my Pebble at home but can't get my watch to connect to the server. Waiting on a reply from the dev of the program. It's definitely the watch app since my server boots. I get /GET 200 fine.

I think after this week, I might stream some games next week. Maybe go through some more obscure titles and support that Linux-y thingy. Other than that I need to et back to my other blog. I want to finish the piece on refugees and then start on a bit about how old politics is destroying the technology age.

The refugee piece might only be 1 more post...

I donâ€™t want to dwell any more on it.

Anywho, Ralkkai, out.
