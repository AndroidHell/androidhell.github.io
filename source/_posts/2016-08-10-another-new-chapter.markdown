A new Chapter, for me usually means I moved somewhere or I did some other glorious thingy. In this case, we moved to Amarillo. We are still in the “woes of unpacking” stage where you sometimes mindlessly dump a box all over the place in hopes that the bits and pieces on the inside end up where you want them to go.

We now reside in a very held-together-with-glue-and-tooth-picks duplex next to a nice couple. He’s Hispanic and she’s white and they are adorable together. He thinks I’m the smartest thing on the planet and I tried explaining that I’m more diligent than smart. He still doesn’t believe it. I know a lot of shit, doesn’t means I’m genius material. More on that maybe in the future.

I’m currently sipping on a Bloody Mary, which is totally outside my element. I.E, it’s not beer. It’s good though. The V8 is spiked with sea salt and clam juice. Nice and rustic.I’d recommend this concoction to any foodie.

Work is still work. Today was a “Field Day” which means all the scientists were busy so I was left to my own devises. I worked on the prototype of my little 3D printed Pi box and spent the second part of the day rewriting my watch app I spun up a few months back in a hasty mess of code. I redid everything and went with the “%H:$M:%S” jazz that was suggested by a colleague. It’s a lot less code and still does the same thing so that is cool. Bonus points for lazy. I wish they spent more time on that concept in school. I did the original version in this barbaric math logic bullshit. It was just a messy piece of shit.

I think that’s all I got for now. No real political rants since it’s all beating dead horses by now. I’m not sure if I still stand by my Johnson vote at this point. I’d rather not have Trump since he will only leave the nation worse off then it is now. Clinton is still meh, but an actual politician, so she knows how the play the game. Idk, in any scenario I feel like I’m throwing my vote away. It’s sad. This isn’t democracy.

In any case, here’s to a new chapter. New 3 bedroom, 1.5bathroom duplex. Ready for baby makin’. I guess that will be the next chapter.
