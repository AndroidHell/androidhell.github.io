So it's Friday again. Made it through another week. One of my last at FP actually. Friday's at Financial Payments, over the duration of my internship have usualyl been fairly laid back. We do a breakfast thing and lately Kin has been promoting us watching TedTalk videos or similar things to create a discussion over foodstuff. It's bee nenjoyable to engage in the talks since it's about stuff that a lot of people I know either don't understand or jsut mark it up as a "never gonna happen" type thing.

Meanwhile, I found a game last night that is loesly based on DnD called Sword Coast Legends on Steam. Shared it with the Linux gaming community on reddit and am now starting to understand why it has mixed reviews. A redditor suggested  Icheck out Neverwinter Nights instead. It can be ran natively on Linux but as the game is 13 years old, I can't find anything substantial in the way of running it and the GOG site says it only supports Windows. I have found stuff tha tsaid it runs better in Wine/PoL on Linux then natively on Windows so that is cool. I might check it out.

The weekend is gonna be busy. Tonight  Ineed to put up the Christmas tree. Tomorrow we need to do gift shopping sicne the family is doing Christams earlier this year. Tomorrow evening the wife and I are supposed to play pool but I might talk her into Star Wars Ep. 7 instead. Postpone pool for another week.

Sunday we need to go grocery shopping and wrap gifts. I'm hoping to talk to Alan at church about a sock drive as wel. I've been putting tha toff for 2 weeks now and it's pretty muc hwinter at this point.

Other than that, I need to stay off of social media until I see SW. People ruin everything.
