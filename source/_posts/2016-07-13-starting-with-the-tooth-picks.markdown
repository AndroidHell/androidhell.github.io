I may have eluded to this a few posts ago but I had a bit of a tweet-fest a few weeks ago concerning the idea of why we should stop learning new things. I did my stint  at college and I should just stop reading new things or tinkering with a new programming language? Why? Just today at work I spent time playing with yet another library for Python that adds another new facet to a always impressive arsenal of tools that is Python. Python is simple as a language but it's estensability is almsot unmatched save for maybe Javascript, and I blame th ejipsters for that. Angular? Do we really need another stack guys?

Spent today playing with a GUI toolkit for Python called Tkinter. It's bascailly a whole library full of al the things you need to make the elements you see on a standards desktop OS window. Window decorations, buttons, text fields, sliders, radios, etc. It's like QT's distant, clunkier cousin. I say this only because QT has a IDE and Tkinter doesn't. 

I spent today breaking windows and sifting through debug garbage while trying to get functioanl buttons. I'm also trying(READ: failing) to get a nested terminal CLI to spit out terminal data as if you were runnign everythign from CLI to begin with. It's not going well.

I also finished the podcast of Sam Harris' and Danial Dennett's barroom debate. I was happy that they finished it as the gentlemen I'd like to think they are even though they deisagreed with each other the entire time. It's wierd readign two of the 4 horsemen, as they are referred to as, discuss the same thing, which they agree on, and yet, all the while disagreeing with each other. The discussion was intence and at times over my head.

After that I started a series from the same podcast wher Harris is dissecting his most recent book since a lot of people apparently wanted to lynch him over it. I'm halfway through the first part but from what I gather, he's trying to cover his ass but explaining that when he was discussing Muslims, he was intending to mena the radical militant ones and not ALL MUSLIMS. He explained that he thoght his listeners understood that he was referencing Islamists and not Religion of Peace Muslims. I'm curious about the book but probably won't read it. And Harris says that the audio version doesn't even p[aint him in the right light. I donno. I'll jsut take his word for it for now as I'm just now diving into the New Atheist philophy stuff. 

I definitely can't defend anything they discuss yet. I don't know where I land on the atheism spectrum but I know I ahve shifted in teh past decade. Is social athesim a thing? And if so, can it be coupled with exestential nihilism? 

<p>I like overwhelming my brain as of late but I need to tread lighltly as nto to seem #verysmart</p>
