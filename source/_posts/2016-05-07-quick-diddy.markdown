So I decided to move this blog to my local computer instead of hosting the dev version on cloud 9. A version will stll be there but it will probably not get updated unless I have a reason to do otherwise. Since I'm just pushing and not actually doing any sort of QC, this shouldn't be an issue and I can set up another repo on my laptop. 

I might consider adding an new method in my rakefile for pulling all the things based on my "rake push" one.

Other then that, I had wanted to write a blog post about how I feel that the MMO is dying after trying to play Ryzom after it got it's debut on Steam after being around for 12 years. I played it, felt very "meh" about it and will probably play Cities: Skylines for the rest of the night. It's holding my attention more anyway. At least, when I'm not chasing down bugs and glitches from mods.

In any case, this is  gonna be shorter anyway since it's more intended to be a teser post to see if I have everything plugged in properly.

Peace,
-D
